at the top, click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Add Assignments page, fill in the following information
(fields marked with a red star are required):

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> Enter a brief title for your assignment
(e.g., <code>Essay 1Â </code>).
</li><li><strong>Open date:</strong> At the open date and time, the
assignment is available for students to begin working on it. To send
an announcement alerting students to the start date, see step 4 below.
</li><li><strong>Due date:</strong> This is the assignment's deadline. To
list the due date on the site's schedule, see step 4 below.
</li><li><strong>Accept until:</strong> No assignments can be
submitted after this date. You can set this date and time later than
the due date to continue accepting assignments (e.g., to allow for
revisions) after the due date.
</li><li><strong>Student submissions:</strong> You can choose to have
students submit their assignments inline only (typed directly into a
text box), as attachments only, or both. You can also allow
non-electronic submissions.
</li><li><strong>Allow resubmission:</strong> You can choose to allow
students to submit the assignment multiple times.
</li><li><strong>Grade scale:</strong> You can choose from five grading
options: <strong><code>Ungraded</code></strong>, <strong><code>Letter grade</code></strong>, <strong><code>Points</code></strong>,
<strong><code>Pass/Fail</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Checkmark</code></strong>. If you choose points, enter
the maximum possible points (must be a positive number or zero).
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>In the "Assignment Instructions" box, type a description of the
assignment.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This step is optional, but you will receive an

Announcements:</strong> To announce the open date automatically when
you post the assignment with an announcement on your site's home page,
