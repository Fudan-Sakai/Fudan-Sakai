<h2>Returning an assignment to a
    student</h2>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>When you click <strong><code>Assignments</code></strong> in the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, you
will see a list of assignments. The "In / New" column displays the
number of submissions that have come in from students (the "In" value)
and the number of new submissions (the "New" value) for each
assignment. These values let you know if you need to take action
regarding an assignment.</p>

<p>Detailed instructions for grading assignments, including information
on returning an assignment, are in the document <a href="content.hlp?docId=arda">Grading or returning an assignment or reviewing student status</a>. Note that once you have begun grading a student's
assignment, you can return the assignment to the student with or
without a grade. You can make comments both within the text submitted
by the student and within the <code>Instructor Comments</code> text
box. To allow the student to resubmit the assignment, check <strong><code>Allow
Resubmission</code></strong>. When you are ready to return the assignment, click
<strong><code>Return to student</code></strong> at the bottom of the screen. In the
"Submissions" list for the assignment, under "Status", you will see
the value "Returned" for the student in question.</p>
