<h2>Assignments: Overview</h2>


<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>For courses, the Assignments tool allows instructors to create,
distribute, collect, and grade online assignments. Assignments are
private; student submissions are not visible to other users of the
site.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>




<p><strong>Multiple grading options:</strong> You can choose letter
grades, points, pass/fail, checkmarks, or ungraded assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple submissions:</strong> You can choose to allow
students to submit an assignment multiple times.</p>


<p><strong>Returning an assignment:</strong> Assignments can be returned, with or
without grades, for resubmission.</p>

<p><strong>Offline review:</strong> Instructors can download all
submissions for an assignment to their computer at once.</p><p /><p><strong>Grade access:</strong> When instructors release grades for an
assignment, students can access instructor comments and their grades.</p>

<p><strong>Student view:</strong> Clicking <strong><code>Student View</code></strong> allows
you as an instructor or site leader to view assignments as they would
appear to your students or project participants. To learn more about
using student view, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzj">Seeing how assignments look to participants</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Honor pledge:</strong> This option requires students to check
a box affirming that they have neither given nor received aid on an
assignment before they can submit it.</p>

<p><strong>Provide scheduled or immediate feedback:</strong> Instructors
can set a model answer or all-purpose item to provide immediate
feedback to an assignment submission, or to provide feedback at a
scheduled date and time.</p>

<p><strong>Private notes:</strong> Instructors can add private notes (i.e., notes students cannot access) to an assignment. </p>
