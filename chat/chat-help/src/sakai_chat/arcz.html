<h2>Chat Room: Overview</h2>


















<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>You can use the Chat Room tool for real-time, unstructured
conversations among site participants who are logged into the site at
the same time.</p>

<p>Instructors can easily create an "Online Office Hours" chat room for
student questions and answers. Dispersed collaboration groups can use
Chat as a space to have conversations across distances or catch up
with conversations that they may have missed.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Multiple rooms:</strong> Site leaders can use
<strong><code>Options</code></strong> to add rooms to accommodate more than one
discussion. Participants can click <strong><code>Change Room</code></strong> to access
other discussions.</p>

<p><strong>Default room:</strong> Site leaders can use
<strong><code>Options</code></strong> to specify which room is visible by default to
participants accessing the tool.</p>

<p><strong>Display:</strong> Changes you make in <strong><code>Options</code></strong> also
apply to how the Chat Room features appear to site participants.</p>

<p><strong>Clear history:</strong> Permanently delete all messages
from a chat room.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>The Chat Room tool alerts users to other participants who have
entered the same chat room. This way, users know who is available to
talk.<br /><br />
</li><li>Site leaders can specify how many chat messages are archived and
for how long, or they can allow participants to configure their own
archive settings. <br /><br />
</li><li>The Chat Room tool does not provide a way to chat privately. By
default, all messages are visible to all participants. However, you
can remove read access for a particular role, and thereby for all
participants with that role, by modifying the Chat Room permissions.
</li></ul>
