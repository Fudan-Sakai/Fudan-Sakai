<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
allows you to upload and download large files, multiple files, or folders of
files to your course or project site more easily.</p>






<p>Before you set up WebDAV, at least one object (i.e., file or
folder) must be in the destination Drop Box tool. For instructions on
adding files without using WebDAV, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcg">Adding, editing, or deleting an item in Drop Box</a>.</p>

<p>Saving files directly to WebDAV (i.e., from within an application,
such as Word, Excel, or Internet Explorer) does not work reliably. For
best results, save the file to your computer first, and then upload it
to your site.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>

<h3>Using Windows Vista</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Connecting to your site's Resources using
WebDAV on a computer running Windows Vista does not work
reliably. Developers are currently investigating this issue. However,
Microsoft has a software update available that may help correct
connection problems for some users. For information about the update
and how to download it, see article 907306 at the Microsoft Help and
Support web site.</p>

<p> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx" target="new">Search
Microsoft Help and Support</a>.</p>


<p>To add a shortcut to your Windows Vista computer that
allows you to upload and access files in Drop Box using WebDAV:</p>

<ol><li>From the desktop, click <strong><code>Computer</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Map Network Drive</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Map Network Drive screen, click <strong><code>Connect to a Web site
that you can use to store your documents and pictures</code></strong>, and then
click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Choose a custom network location</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Internet or network address" field, enter a URL that
points to the destination Drop Box tool, and then click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format. It will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected. To delete an item, right-click it
and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Windows XP</h3>

<p>To use the Add Network Place Wizard to add a shortcut to your computer 
that allows you to upload and access files in Drop Box using WebDAV:</p>

<ol><li>On the desktop, double-click <strong><code>My Network Places</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Network Tasks" pane, click <strong><code>Add a network place</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the welcome screen, click <strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Select <strong><code>Choose another network location</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Next</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Internet or network address:" field, enter a URL that
points to the destination Drop Box tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format. It will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected. However, you cannot delete items
from a site by dragging them to the Recycle Bin on your desktop. To
delete an item, right-click it and select <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard)</h3>

<p>To use WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and
10.5 (Leopard):</p>

<ol><li>In the Finder, press <code>Command-kÂ </code>. (Alternatively, 
from the <strong><code>Go</code></strong> menu, choose <strong><code>Connect to Server</code></strong>.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter the URL that points to
the destination Resources tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may click the <strong><code>+</code></strong> (plus sign) to the right
of the server address after you enter it, and the server will be added
to your list of favorite servers.</p>

<p>When you log in, you can choose to have the passphrase remembered
in your Keychain. If you do this, you will not be prompted for a
passphrase when you log into your personal Resources or the Resources
for any site to which you have access. Do not do this unless your
computer is secured from use by others.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access resources using
this method, you may notice that <code>.DS_store</code> files are
being created. Apple's knowledge base provides <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1629" target="new">instructions</a>
for eliminating this behavior. </p>

<h3>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and earlier</h3>

<p>Using WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and
earlier requires a third-party client called Goliath.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Goliath has some known performance issues, and
may not work 100% of the time. Because of this, only limited support
is available if you experience problems. </p>

<p>You can download a free copy of Goliath from:</p>

<span class="example">  <a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz" target="new">http://www.webdav.org/goliath/installs/Goliath1_0_1.dmg.gz</a></span>

<p>Once you have downloaded the file, double-click it to decompress
it. Then double-click the resulting <code>.dmg</code> file. A
disk image named <code>Goliath 1.0.1</code> should now be
available. Then:</p>

<ol><li>Drag and drop the Goliath folder contained within the disk image
to your hard disk.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Open the Goliath application.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter the URL that points to
the destination Resources tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li></ol>


<p>The first time you attempt to connect, you may be prompted to
accept a certificate for the site. Click <strong><code>OK</code></strong> if prompted.</p>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>
