<a name="about"> </a><h3>About WebDAV</h3>


<p>WebDAV (Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning)
allows you to upload and download large files, multiple files, or folders of
files to your course or project site more easily.</p>



<p>You can use WebDAV to upload and access files in your site's
Resources or Drop Box, if you have the required permissions.</p>




<p>Consider the following:</p>

<ul><li>Before you set up WebDAV, at least one object (i.e., file or
folder) must be in the destination Resources or Drop Box tool. For
help, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arfs">Resources</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcg">Adding, editing, or deleting an item in Drop Box</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Set up WebDAV separately for each site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Saving files to your site directly from within an application
(e.g., Word or Excel) does not work reliably. For best results, save
the file to your computer first, and then upload it to your site.
</li></ul>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Filenames that include certain characters
cannot be accepted. For a list of unsupported characters, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=auze">Unsupported characters</a>.</p>

<a name="tiger"> </a><h3>Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and later</h3>

<p>To use WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and
later:</p>



<ol><li>In the Finder, press
<code>Command-kÂ </code>. (Alternatively, from the <strong><code>Go</code></strong>
menu, choose <strong><code>Connect to Server</code></strong>.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter a URL that points to
the destination tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for the URL's format; it will
likely include the siteID for your site. For instructions on finding
your siteID, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>Enter your username and password if prompted.
</li></ol>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>

<p>Optionally, you may click the
<strong><code>+</code></strong> (plus sign) to the right of the server address after you
enter it, and the server will be added to your list of favorite
servers.</p>



<p>When you log in, you can choose to have the passphrase
remembered in your Keychain. If you do this, you will not
be prompted for a passphrase when you log into your personal Resources
or Drop Box or the Resources for any site to which you have access. Do
not do this unless your computer is secured from use by others.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you use WebDAV to access resources using
this method, you may notice that <code>.DS_store</code> files are
being created. Apple's knowledge base provides <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1629" target="new">instructions for eliminating this 
behavior</a>.</p>

<a name="panther"> </a><h3>Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and earlier</h3>


<p>Using WebDAV to upload and access files in Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and
earlier requires a third-party client called Goliath.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Goliath has some known performance issues, and
may not work all of the time. Because of this, only limited support
is available if you experience problems. </p>

<p>You can <a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/#download">download a free copy of Goliath</a>.  Once you have downloaded the file:</p>

<ol><li>Double-click the file to decompress it. Then double-click the
resulting <code>.dmg</code> file. (Depending on your version and
configuration of StuffIt, the disk image may
automatically mount.)

<br /><br />
</li><li>A disk image named <code>Goliath 1.0.1</code> should now be
available. Drag and drop the Goliath folder contained within the disk
image to your hard disk.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Open the Goliath application.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Server Address:" field, enter a URL that points to the
destination tool.

<p>Contact your site administrator for
the URL's format; it will likely include the siteID for your site.</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong> For instructions on finding your siteID, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.</p>
</li><li>Enter your username and password if prompted.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click the <strong><code>Advanced settings</code></strong> tab, and check <strong><code>Disable
Encoding of Macintosh Recourse</code></strong>.  Then click <strong><code>OK</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>The first time you attempt to connect, you may be prompted to
accept a certificate for the site. Click <strong><code>OK</code></strong> if prompted.</p>

<p>You may now drag and drop folders between your computer and the
sites to which you just connected.</p>
