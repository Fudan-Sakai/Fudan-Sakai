<h2>WebDAV</h2><h3>What it does</h3>

<p>WebDAV allows you to easily transfer files and folders
from your local computer to your Resources folder in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>, a <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">course site</a>, or a <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project
site</a>. WebDAV stands for "Web-based Distributed Authoring and
Versioning". It is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol
that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage files on remote
web servers.</p>

<p>Once you have set up WebDAV, your computer will treat your
Resources section like any other folder on your local system. You will
be able to drag and drop files and folders from Resources just as you
would in My Computer or Computer in Windows, or the Finder
on a Mac.</p>

<p>For more information about WebDAV, including technical specifications
and major features, see the <a href="http://www.webdav.org/other/faq.html" target="new">WebDAV FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>




<p><strong>Setup options:</strong> For
Windows 7 and Vista, it is recommended that you
download AnyClient for WebDAV connections. On a Windows XP
computer, you can make WebDAV connections through My Network Places.
Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and newer supports secure WebDAV
connections in the Finder. If you use Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) or
earlier, download <a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/" target="new">Goliath</a>
to use WebDAV.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>There must be at least one object (i.e., file or folder) in your
Resources section before you set up WebDAV.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you are using WebDAV in Windows and have mapped a drive to the
application  via Network Places, you cannot delete a
file by dragging it from the Network Place window to the Recycle
Bin. Instead, select the file and click <strong><code>Delete</code></strong>.  

<br /><br />
</li><li>WebDAV will require you to enter the siteID for each site you wish
to access. The siteID is a unique identifier for each worksite. To
find the siteID, in the worksite's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click
<strong><code>Resources</code></strong>.  Click <strong><code>Upload-Download Multiple
Resources</code></strong>. Your site ID should appear near the top of the page. 
Alternatively, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atla">Determining your site's siteID</a>.
