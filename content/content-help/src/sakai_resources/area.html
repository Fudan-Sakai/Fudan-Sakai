<h2>Resources: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Using the Resources tool, you can share many kinds of material
securely with members of your site, or make them available to the
public. You also have your own private Resources area in your <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>.</p>

<p>You can upload files (e.g., word processing documents,
spreadsheets, slide presentations, and videos), as well as create and
post HTML (web) pages and simple text documents, and share links to
useful web sites.</p>

<p>You can organize your Resources items into folders, and you can
control which groups or types of users can access and add to
different folders.</p>

<p>Also, you can show or hide an item at any time, and set a start
and/or end time for its availability.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Viewing items:</strong> When you click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong> in a
site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, you will see a list of that site's
Resources items. Click the title of an item to open it.</p>

<p>To view the contents of a folder, click the folder's name to enter
it, or click the folder icon to expand its contents in the list. To
expand or collapse all folders, at the top, next to "Title", click the
black double arrow.</p>

<p>You can sort items by title, size, resource creator, and last
modified date. Site leaders can customize the order in which items
appear.</p>

<p><strong>Adding items:</strong> To add an item, from
the <strong><code>Add</code></strong> menu next to the folder where you want to
store the item, choose the type of item to add.</p>

<p><strong>Organizing items:</strong> Site leaders can organize items
into folders and subfolders, and customize the order in which items
appear. To reorder items, from the <strong><code>Actions</code></strong> menu, select
<strong><code>Reorder</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing resources:</strong> Each item is available via a
URL, which you can share with site participants.</p>

<p><strong>Drag and drop:</strong> You can drag and drop files to and
from your desktop using WebDAV. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=araf">Uploading files to Resources or Drop Box using WebDAV with Windows</a> or <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyi">Uploading files to Resources or Drop Box using WebDAV with Mac OS X</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Group spaces:</strong> You can share items with pre-defined
groups, which gives you more control over who has access to Resources
items.</p>

<p><strong>Controlling access:</strong> Using the Permissions feature,
site owners can control which types of users can read, post, revise,
and/or delete files in specific folders. Site owners and instructors
can make a resource available to anyone by choosing to post it with
the "public view" setting checked.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Many classes post weekly readings in their Resources. These can
include links to web sites as well as to other kinds of documents, like
Adobe PDF files. Some classes also post presentations or
slides used in lectures.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>By setting folder permissions, a large collaboration site can use
one folder in Resources as a space to archive important documents, and
allow only certain site participants to modify those documents.
</li></ul>
