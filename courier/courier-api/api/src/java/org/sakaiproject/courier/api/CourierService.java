 * CourierService is the Interface for a Sakai service which can be used to push messages from the Sakai server components to the user interface in the browser.<br />
 * It is used mostly to cause a tool in a particular portal instance to be refreshed to respond to a change noticed at the server.

 * <p>
 * An Address identifies a particular client's window: it merges the Usage session, the window's portal page location, and perhaps the tool id (for floating tool windows).
 * </p>

 * A Delivery object captures the Address, the HTML Element Id involved, and any other details of a particular type of delivery.
