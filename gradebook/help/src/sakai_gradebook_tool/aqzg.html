<h2>Using Gradebook to view and export
student grades</h2>














<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To view and export student grades from Gradebook:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top, click <strong><code>All Grades</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You will see a list of students whom you are authorized to grade,
their scores on all graded items, and their cumulative scores. You can
search for a particular student by name or ID. If your course has
defined sections or groups whose members you are authorized to grade,
you will be able to filter the roster to display those sections or
groups one at a time. If your course does not yet have any students
enrolled, you will see the message, "No students to display".

<p>Next to "View", use the drop-down lists to view the roster by
section, group, or category.</p>
</li><li>To export grades, in the upper right, click either <strong><code>Export as
CSV</code></strong> (results in a <code>.csv</code> file) or <strong><code>Export for
Excel</code></strong> (results in an <code>.xls</code> file).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All visible class data is exported. If you
filter your roster or sort by column before exporting, it will be
reflected in the output.</p>
</li><li>The exported fields and the names of the column headers are
"Student Name", "Student ID", and the name of the Gradebook item. The
full student names and complete Gradebook item names are
exported. Gradebook item point values will only export up to two
decimal places. Scores are listed in the Gradebook item name column.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you are finished viewing and exporting grades, click
<strong><code>Gradebook Items</code></strong> to return to the main Gradebook menu.
