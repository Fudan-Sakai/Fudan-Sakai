<h2>Gradebook: Overview</h2>















<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Gradebook is a tool for instructors to calculate and store grade
information and distribute it to students online.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Using the Gradebook, instructors can:</p>

<ul><li>Autocalculate course grades, with the ability to override any
course grade

<br /><br />
</li><li>Define course letter grades based on a 100% scale

<br /><br />
</li><li>Choose between point- or percentage-based grading

<br /><br />
</li><li>Create categories to organize items and allow for weighting of
grades

<br /><br />
</li><li>Enter, view, edit, and release to students scores, grades, and
comments

<br /><br />
</li><li>Transmit scores to the Gradebook from tools such as Tests &amp;
Quizzes, Assignments, and Forums

<br /><br />
</li><li>Export scores and grades to Microsoft Excel (in <code>.csv</code>
format)

<br /><br />
</li><li>Import item scores from spreadsheet (<code>.csv</code>) files.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Viewing scores:</strong> The Gradebook lets students view
their own scores and grades once instructors have released them.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>Instructors can view information in the Gradebook in different
ways, including an item summary for each course, item detail, all
grade listing, course grade listing, gradebook setup, and course grade
options.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Students can view their scores for all items; view their course
grades, once an instructor releases them; and sort their items by
title, due date, grade, and weight, where applicable.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The Gradebook is section aware, so assistants can see grades only
for students in their particular sections.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Currently, the Gradebook does not allow you to assign extra credit
or drop the lowest score.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Instructors can import grades. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aukf">Importing grades from a spreadsheet</a>.
</li></ul>
