<h2>Overriding an autocalculated course
grade</h2>














<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>The Gradebook automatically calculates a course grade based on the
number of points scored out of the total points submitted (i.e., a
running grade). Ungraded items will not be included in the course
grade calculation, so the course grade column will not necessarily
reflect the student's true score. If you want to include ungraded
items in the course grade calculation, you must enter a 0 (zero) for
those items.</p>

<p>By default, the option for displaying a course grade is disabled,
and students see only their scores for each item. To display a course
grade to students, click <strong><code>Course Grade Options</code></strong>, check the box
next to <strong><code>Display course grade to students now</code></strong>, and then click
<strong><code>Save</code></strong>.</p>

<p>To override the autocalculated course grade:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Choose <strong><code>Course Grades</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled students
and their calculated course grades. In the "Grade Override" column,
enter the new course grade(s) to replace the autocalculated grade(s).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When manually entering a course grade, you must
use the appropriate grade type for the Gradebook in which you are
working. For example, if the course is graded on a simple letter grade
scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code> A </code>, <code> B </code>,
<code> C </code>, <code> D </code>, or
<code> F </code>. If the course is graded on a standard
letter grade scale, you will also be able to add
<code> + </code> (plus sign) or <code> - </code>
(minus sign) to the letter grade. If the course is graded on a
Pass/Not pass scale, you will only be able to enter the letters
<code> P </code> or <code> N </code>.</p>
</li><li>When you have finished updating any course grades you want to
change, click <strong><code>Save Changes</code></strong>. A log of the grade change and the
author is created.
</li></ol>

<p>If you have overridden a course grade and you want to revert back
to the autocalculated grade:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Gradebook</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Choose <strong><code>Course Grades</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the resulting page, you will see a list of enrolled
students. If you have overridden a course grade for a student, you
will see the grade you manually entered in an editable field in the
"Grade Override" column. To revert back to the autocalculated course
grade, delete the manually entered grade and click <strong><code>Save Changes</code></strong>. The
log of the student's grade will be updated to reflect the change and
the author.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will have to delete the manually entered
grade and click <strong><code>Save Changes</code></strong> for each grade you want to change back.</p>
