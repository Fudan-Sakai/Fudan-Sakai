<h2>Viewing course grades</h2>














<p>In Gradebook, both students and instructors can view current
scores.</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>When you enter Gradebook, depending on what information your
instructor has made available, you will see one or both of the
following:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Course Grade:</strong> The course grade is a cumulative
grade based on items you have completed. Any items you have not
completed are not included in the course grade calculation unless your
instructor has explicitly assigned zeroes to those items. A grade
percentage appears in parentheses and shows the actual percentage
derived from completed items.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Gradebook Items:</strong> The list of gradebook items shows
each item name, its due date (if applicable), your grade, and any
comments associated with the grade.</li></ul>


<h3>Instructors</h3>

<h4>Setting score display options</h4>

<p>Instructors can choose to make available individual gradebook items,
as well as cumulative course grades. See <a href="content.hlp?docId=arah">Making grades available to students</a>.</p>

<h4>Viewing grades</h4>

<p>When you enter Gradebook, you will see an average course grade for the
class and a list of individual gradebook items. You can view
cumulative scores using one of the following options.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When viewing grades in tables, you can sort on
many of the columns; click the column heading by which you want to
sort the table. Subsequently clicking the same column heading will
switch the sorting order between ascending and descending.  </p>

<ul><li>Near the top, click <strong><code>Course Grades</code></strong>. You will see a list of
your students. For most gradebooks, the points earned, the letter grade,
and a percentage are displayed for each student.  (The display may vary based
on your gradebook setup.) The letter grade and percentage are
based on the items that have been completed. To include
items that have not been completed in the course grade calculation,
you must enter a zero (0) for each item.

<p>To view the course grade by section or group, use the "View"
drop-down list to select the section or group. You can also
use the text box to search for individual students.</p>

<p>By default, 50 students are visible.  To display more or fewer
students, in the drop-down list above the table on the right, change
<strong><code>Show 50</code></strong> to your desired option.</p>
</li><li>Near the top, click <strong><code>All Grades</code></strong>. You will see a list of
your students, and a course grade and a point value for each item in
the Gradebook. The course grade is only shown as a percentage in this
view and is based on the items that have been completed. To include
items that have not been completed in the course grade calculation,
you must enter a zero (0) for each item.

<p>To view the roster by section, group, or category, use the "View"
drop-down list. You can also use the text box to search for
individual students.</p>

<p>By default, 50 students are visible.  To display more or fewer
students, in the drop-down list above the table on the right, change
<strong><code>Show 50</code></strong> to your desired option.</p>
