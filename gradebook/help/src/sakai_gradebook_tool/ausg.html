<h2>Course grade calculations</h2>















<p>The Gradebook automatically calculates a course grade based on the
number of points scored out of the total points submitted (i.e., a
running grade).  Ungraded items will not be included in the course
grade calculation, so the course grade will not necessarily reflect
the student's true score. To include ungraded items in the
course grade calculation, you need to enter a 0 (zero) for those items.</p>

<p>To exclude a gradebook item from the course grade, you can edit the
gradebook item and deselect <strong><code>Include this item in course grade
calculations</code></strong>. The score for that item will appear in parentheses
to indicate that it is not included in the course grade calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Students can't see their grades for an item
unless you select <strong><code>Release this item to students</code></strong> when editing
the gradebook item.</p>

<p>For instructions on adding or editing Gradebook items, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aran">Adding, editing, or deleting a Gradebook item</a>.</p>
