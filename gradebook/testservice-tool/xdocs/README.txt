The Gradebook "testservice-tool" is an tacky little Sakai tool to let developers do primitive (but quick) testing of the Gradebook service from non-Gradebook code in Sakai. Very occasionally this has been useful when investigating component system changes or interapplication problems.

It's For Developers Only, and should never be deployed to a production site.
