GRADEBOOK INTEGRATION NOTES

The Gradebook can build and deploy a standalone version for easy development,
testing, and demos. But the application code is designed to be embededded in an
LMS framework and integrated with external assessment tools. Here are some
pointers for integrators.


1. INTERFACES

There are three sets of integration interfaces: the gradebook service (which
integrators call), the facades (which integrators implement), and the
SectionAwareness service (shared by Gradebook and Tests & Quizzes). You can
find more information on the Section Awareness package in "sakai/sections".
This document focuses on the Gradebook specifics.

1.1. Gradebook Service

The Gradebook external service interface is defined at:

  gradebook/service/api/src/java/org/sakaiproject/service/gradebook/shared/GradebookService.java

In Sakai 2.2, the Gradebook has four known programmatic clients: site management
(which creates a new gradebook instance for the site), Tests & Quizzes and Assignments
(which adds and scores externally-managed assignments), and Message Center
(which gets assignment data and, if the user is permitted, updates scores).

1.2 Facades

The "facade" interfaces provide a stable focus by which the Gradebook reaches
necessary (but not Gradebook-specific) data. Along with SectionAwareness, they
specify all that's required to fully integrate the Gradebook application. The
interfaces are defined in:

  gradebook/service/api/src/java/org/sakaiproject/tool/gradebook/facades
    Authn.java
    Authz.java
    ContextManagement.java
    UserDirectoryService.java

There are several implementations of these interfaces in the current code. For
example, everything that's specific to the Sakai 2.1 framework can be found in:

  gradebook/service/impl/src/java/org/sakaiproject/tool/gradebook/facades/sakai2impl


2. RESOURCES


Web pages and configuration files common across any deployment of the
application are kept in:

  gradebook/app/ui/src/webapp

Resources specific to embedding in Sakai 2.2 are in:

  gradebook/app/sakai-tool/src/webapp

Similarly, resources specific to the test standalone deployment are in:

  gradebook/app/standalone-app/src/webapp

Integrators will want to take special note of the configuration files in each
directory's "WEB-INF".
