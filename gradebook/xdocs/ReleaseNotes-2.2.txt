GRADEBOOK RELEASE NOTES

Changes in Sakai 2.2
====================

New features
------------

* Configurable grading scales are now supported. For details, see
  "gradebook/xdocs/add_custom_grade_mappings.txt".


Changed features
----------------

* Simplified and coordinated student view

  Before 2.2, the instructor's view of assignment scores (as numbers) differed
  drastically from the student's view of assignment scores (as letter grades),
  but there was no way for the instructor to see the student's view.

  The UI has been simplified to coordinate the two views. Now both instructors
  and students see numeric scores for assignments and letter grades for course
  grades.

  (Full configurable support of letter-graded assignments and addition of
  a "view as student" page are both feature requests for future releases.)

* Date formats are now internationalized.

* NOT VISIBLE TO END USERS - New methods have been added to the callable
  GradebookService:

  - updateExternalAssessmentScores
  - setAvailableGradingScales
  - setDefaultGradingScale

  The following methods were added as of 2.1.2:

  - isGradebookDefined
  - isAssignmentDefined
  - isUserAbleToGradeStudent
  - getAssignments
  - getAssignmentScore
  - setAssignmentScore

  For details, see the GradebookService JavaDoc.

* NOT VISIBLE TO END USERS - The build and deployment structures of the
Gradebook project have changed in the following ways:

  - Service and application logic is more cleanly separated and layered.
  - The Gradebook service implementation is deployed as a standard Sakai
    component, capable of sharing Hibernate-Spring managed transactions
    with other components.
  - Both the Sakai-integrated tool and standalone application are always
    built by "maven sakai". The "-Dstandalone=true" flag only determines
    if the standalone WAR is automatically deployed to Tomcat.

  See the technical documentation in the "gradebook/xdocs" directory for
  details.


Database changes
----------------

* New tables were added and a new column was added to the GB_GRADE_MAP_T
  table to support configurable grading scales. Some indexes were added to
  improve performance of common operations. The SQL table definitions
  for supported databases have been updated. For existing installations,
  the "auto.ddl=true" property or the following script may be used to
  update the tables:
