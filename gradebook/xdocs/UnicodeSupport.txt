Unicode support is dependent on the underlying database. That is, if the database stores and returns UTF-8 characters, that's what the Gradebook application will store and retrieve.

If, for example, you create a MySQL 4.1 database and tables with a default character set of "latin1".

  mysql> show create database gradebook_db;
  ... ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 ...

Then UTF-8 characters will not be obtained (or displayed) correctly.

If you've installed your database server to use something other than "utf8" as a default character set, then you can probably reset the default for particular databases.

In MySQL or Oracle, for example, you could back up the tables, drop the tables, issue the following command, and then recreate the tables:

  alter database gradebook_db character set utf8;
