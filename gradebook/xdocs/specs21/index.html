<h2>I. Introduction<a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a></h2>
<p>The Sakai gradebook is a collaborative effort  to produce a simple, open source tool for calculating, storing and disseminating grade information online. Design and development is being led by MIT and UC Berkeley with key support from the other Sakai core institutions. Plans for further development of the Sakai gradebook are outlined in Section VII.</p>
<h2>II. Summary<a name="Summary" id="Summary"></a> </h2>
<p>A. The Sakai 2.1 gradebook will enable instructors to:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Autocalculate course grades </li>
  <li>Establish and edit a mapping of the course letter grade to a 100 percent scale </li>
  <li>Add, view, edit and release to students the class assignments/assessments (straight point values only) </li>
  <li>Manually enter, view, edit and release to students their scores and grades </li>
  <li>Automatically import assignments and scores from Samigo </li>
  <li>Export scores and grades in excel, csv format </li>
  <li>Filter student lists by section</li>
  <li>Keep log of grading activity for each student's work</li>

<h4>1. Assignment Summary </h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The assignment title has a maximum character length of 255 and it is displayed in its entirety. There are currently no limitations on character types in the name.</li>
  <li>The average score is the mean of all values &gt;= 0 that have been entered for the assignment. Blanks are not treated as zeros for purposes of the calculation. Values are displayed as integers, and are not rounded up. (e.g. an average  of 87.88 is displayed as '87')</li>
  <li>Options link: 'Edit assignment settings' links to View 4.</li>
  <li>Options link: Remove assignment from gradebook' links to View 6.</li>
</ol>

<h4>2. Previous/Next Assignment Navigation</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>All unsaved score values will be discarded upon Previous/Return/Overview navigation</li>
  <li>Entered search values for which find has <strong>not</strong> been activated will carry over upon Previous/Overview navigation</li>
  <li>The set of students currently being viewed will carry over upon Previous/Overview navigation, i.e., if students 21-40 are being viewed in assignment 1, those same students will be in the active view when Next is clicked.</li>
</ol>

<h4>3. New scores saved message</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Example confirmation message.</li>
</ol>

<h4>4. <strong>Table Sorting Rules</strong></h4>
<ol type="a">

  <li>Blanks or no scores sort to the top of the list </li>
  <li>Subsorting for non-default sorts is by student name. </li>
  <li>The sort order is preserved for the duration of the session.</li>
  <li>When sorting is changed, the paging resets to the first page</li>
</ol>

<h4>5. Find Rules </h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Initial value: as in wireframe. When the focus comes to this field, the initial value disappears.</li>
  <li>If there is no match, the page reloads, there is a note where the listing table would be saying no results found for &quot;[the search term]&quot; The &quot;Find&quot; and &quot;Assignment&quot; values return to the initial values. </li>
  <li>The last established students per page value is retained and displayed. (Use the style specified for alert messages in the style guide.)</li>
  <li>For search values, only the last space-or-comma-separated value is treated as a substring:
<p>Copp <br />
Francis Ford Copp <br />
Coppola, Francis F<br />
ffcoppola@niebaum.edu<br />
ffcopp
</p>
<p>All return <strong>Coppola, Francis Ford</strong><br />
<br />
Francis F. Coppola<br />
<br />
Returns an <strong>error</strong></p>
</li>
  <li>Case is ignored.</li>
  <li>Truncation or wild card symbols are not supported.</li>
  <li>Clear resets the view to the default, except for the students per page, if that value has been changed during the session.</li>
  <li>The enter key executes Find if the search box has focus</li>
</ol>

<h4>6. View filter</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>If the user is only authorized to administer one section, or if there is only one section in this class, this drop down menu does not appear.</li>
  <li>When the user can administer multiple sections, the dropdown menu offers an option for each section/group as well as an option for "All groups."</li>
</ol>

<h4>7. Save</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The Save button saves newly entered data and refreshes the view (average score is updated and 'changes saved' message added to top of page). The last executed search and students per page values are retained and displayed upon refresh. </li>
  <li>The save button is the <strong>only</strong> mechanism for saving score data. The enter key executes Save if the score boxes have focus.</li>
  <li>If newly entered data is not saved, it will be discarded upon using any of the gradebook's internal (as opposed to the browser's or Sakai framework's) navigation or find/show functionality. The gradebook supports the back button, although this is not currently true of most Sakai tools. </li>
  <li>If two or more users are simultaneously attempting to edit the same student's score, the second of the scores to be submitted will overwrite the first.</li>
  <li>If bad score values are entered, upon save an error message is generated </li>
</ol>

<h4>8. Cancel button</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Any new form data is discarded and the user returns to the Overview page. </li>
</ol>

<h4>9. Point Entry</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Values must be &gt;= 0. Decimal values of up to 2 places are accepted, e.g. 9.75. Commas and other non-numerical characters are not accepted.</li>
  <li> Illegitimate values generate an error message: &quot;Please enter only scores &gt;=0 of up to 2 decimal places. &quot;</li>
  <li>Error messages are also generated next to each of the fields with bad values: &quot;Please enter valid grade.&quot;</li>
  <li>After values are saved, the maximum number of visible characters in text box = 3; these are right aligned. Values &gt; 3 characters are scrollable.</li>
  <li>Scores submitted via the Tests and Quizzes tool cannot be edited in the gradebook.</li>
</ol>

<h4>10. Grade Change Log</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Clicking the log icon reveals the div shown in image above.</li>
  <li>Every grade change made, including the initial grade set, is listed in reverse chronological order. </li>
  <li>The date, score set, and person or agent making the change is shown</li>
  <li>A small "[x]" in the corner of the div cna be clicked to hide the div again.</li>
</ol>



<h3><a name="Final" id="Final"></a>C.  Final Grade detail -- View 2a</h3>
<p>This view is similar to view 2. UI components  not in View 2 are noted.</p>
<img src="2a.gif" alt="Wireframe of View 2a.gif" width="441" height="500" />
<p class="caption">Wireframe of View 2a</p>

<h4>1. Course Summary</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Points: Total possible points of  all assignments currently entered into the gradebook directly and/or via SAMigo.</li>
  <li>Average Score: The mean of all possible score values for all assignments. Blank scores are treated as zeros for calculation purposes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>2. Calculated Grade </h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>The calculated grade field is by default filled with the grade calculated by the gradebook (A, B . . .or A-, B+ . . . or P/NP) and the percentage the grade is based on. </li>
  <li>The grade is always calculated as the current percentage of points scored out of the total possible points of all assignments entered in the gradebook. Consequently, the grades that the instructors  see are unlikely to reflect students' current performance in the class, unless or until all of the assignments have been scored.</li>
  <li>For purposes of calculating the course grade, a student's cumulative average percentage is never rounded up. For example, a student who achieves an overall percentage of 79.99 would receive a course grade of C+, if the lower threshold for a B- is 80%. </li>
</ol>

<h4>3. Grade Override</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Override values must be of the appropriate grade type (A, B . . . or A-, B+ . . .or P/NP) or an error is generated: &quot;The gradebook uses the grade type [pass/not pass|simple letter grade|letter grade +/-]. Please enter only values that correspond to the grade type X.&quot;</li>
  <li>Error messages are also generated next to each of the fields with bad values: &quot;Please enter valid grade.&quot;</li>
  <li>Saved overrides appear in the entry field as editable values.</li>
  <li>Values identical to the calculated course grade are treated as legitimate entries and do not generate an error.</li>
  <li>Deleting a saved overridden value, leaving the entry field blank and executing a save returns the course grade to the calculated value.</li>
</ol>

<h4>4. Export </h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li>Files are exported in .xls and .csv format</li>
  <li>The file name format is &quot;course_grade_[courseID]__date.*&quot;.  If the class number is not available  use 'course_grade_050611. Date format should follow the style guide.</li>
  <li>Exported fields and the names of the Excel column headers are Student Name, Student ID, Course Grade. The full student display names and complete assignment names are exported. Point values are chopped at 2 decimal places.</li>
  <li>Scores are listed in the assignment name column</li>
  <li>Point values are chopped at 2 decimal places.</li>
  <li>Exported data is for the course grade only</li>
  <li>All available roster data is exported. Filtering the view by student does not affect the output.</li>
  <li>The exported data is always sorted by the application default, student display name </li>
  <li>There is no navigation state change after clicking these buttons</li>
</ol>

<h4>2. Course Grade</h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong>Visibility</strong>: This is visible if the instructor has checked the 'Display Final Grade' checkbox in view 5.</li>
  <li><strong>Calculation</strong>: The final grade display is always based on the percentage of points scored out of the total possible points of all assignments entered in the gradebook. If the instructor releases the course grade before all of the assignments have been scored, the grades that the students see at any one time are unlikely to reflect their current performance in the class.</li>
