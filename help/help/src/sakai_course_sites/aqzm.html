<h2>How to navigate</h2>
<p>Following is a brief overview of features and how to navigate:</p>

<ul><li><a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> is your individual online workspace. When
you first log in, you go to My Workspace automatically. To return to
your workspace after visiting other sites, click <strong><code>My Workspace</code></strong>
in the upper left corner of the screen.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Sites appear as tabs across the top
of the screen. Click a tab to go to the corresponding site. <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">Course
sites</a> are associated with courses; project sites are for projects and
other collaborative activities; portfolio sites provide space to
collect, organize, and present work toward specific goals.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are not yet a member of any site, you
will see only a My Workspace tab. For information about joining sites,
see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arel">Membership: Overview</a>.</p>
</li><li>The <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> is a customizable column along the left
side of the screen with links for each available tool (e.g.,
<strong><code>Announcements</code></strong>, <strong><code>Forums</code></strong>). The number of links will
vary depending on which tools were chosen for a site. Click the tool's
name to go to the corresponding tool.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the menubar takes you to the home page for the
site you're in. Home pages can contain a list of recent announcements,
recent discussion items, and selected resources.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you're using a tool, the reset
button <div class="inlineimage image"><img class="noborder" src="image/a009j.jpg" alt="The reset button" /></div> , located to the left of the tool's name,
takes you back to the first page of that tool and resets the
tool. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can get help by clicking <strong><code>Help</code></strong> on the menubar. You can
also get contextual help by clicking the blue question mark
 <div class="inlineimage image"><img class="noborder" src="image/a012y.gif" alt="Help" /></div>  in the upper right corner of each page.

</li></ul>
