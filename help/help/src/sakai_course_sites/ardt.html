<h2>Site types: Overview</h2>





<h3>What they are</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Course sites:</strong> A
course site is the official worksite for a particular academic course
for an institution and can be linked to a database (such as a
registrar's) to automatically populate its roster.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Project sites:</strong> Project sites are designed to
facilitate collaboration. You can invite anyone you wish to join your
project site.



<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Portfolio sites:</strong>
Portfolio sites offer workflows for a variety of purposes, including
assessing and showcasing learning, documenting and sharing skills and
accomplishments, and collecting data for programmatic and
institutional accreditation.
</li></ul>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Customization:</strong> You can choose from features and
functions to create sites that meet your needs. Here are some
examples:</p>

<ul><li>A course web site where students can work on and submit assignments

<br /><br />
</li><li>A portfolio site offering guidance and customized data structures to
create portfolios for specific purposes

<br /><br />
</li><li>A web site where an instructor or project director can make
announcements and share resources, such as documents or links to other
web sites

<br /><br />
</li><li>A web site that serves as an online discussion board
</li></ul>

<p><strong>My Workspace:</strong> When you log in, you will
automatically open a site called <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>. All users
get their own My Workspace site.</p>

<p><strong>Tabs:</strong> When you log in, the course, project, and
portfolio sites to which you belong are displayed as tabs across the
top of the screen. To enter a site, click its tab. If you belong to
more sites than can be displayed as tabs, click
<strong><code>- more -</code></strong> to access the rest.</p>

<p>You can choose to hide sites (e.g., course sites from previous
semesters) or reorder them (i.e., choose which sites to display in
tabs) using the Preferences tool in My Workspace; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arox">Showing, hiding, and ordering sites</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Menubar:</strong> Sites can have just a few or several
functions (including announcements, a schedule, an online discussion area,
assignments, electronic resources, a chat area, and more).  You can
choose which tools to include in your site, and they are added to the
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> along the left side of the screen. To access a
tool, click its name in the menubar. Sites also have a home page,
accessed by clicking <strong><code>Home</code></strong> in the menubar.  </p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>For best results, use a supported browser; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=asxg">Which browser should I use?</a>
