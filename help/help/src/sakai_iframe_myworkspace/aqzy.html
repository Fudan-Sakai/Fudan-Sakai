<h2>My Workspace: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>My Workspace is an individual online worksite that functions as a
private workspace for each user. When you log in, you will
automatically open My Workspace, which will display the Message of the
Day and My Workspace Information boxes. By default, these boxes
contain announcements and information from the system administrator.</p>

<p>You can revise the title and frame height of the My Workspace
Information box by clicking <strong><code>Options</code></strong> in the My Workspace
Information box.</p>

<p>Only a system administrator can modify the contents of the Message of
the Day box, but you can customize how announcements will display in
the window. To do so, click <strong><code>Options</code></strong> under "Message of the
Day".</p>
