<h2>Preferences: Overview</h2>
<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>In <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can set preferences for how and how
often you receive email notification of worksite activity, such as
Announcements, Email Archive, Resources, and Syllabus. You can also
choose which worksites appear in your navigation, and which worksites
have their own tabs.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3> 

<p><strong>Notification methods:</strong> You may choose from several
notification methods for Announcement, Email Archive, Resources, and
Syllabus activity:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Receive each notification separately:</strong> You receive
email notification each time that an Announcement is posted, a
Resource is added, or email is sent.
<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Receive one email per day:</strong> Individual Announcements,
Resources, Syllabus activity, and/or mail messages are bundled into a 
single email message and sent to you daily. 
<br /><br /> 
</li><li><strong>Do not send me low priority notifications:</strong> You
receive no notification regarding low priority site activity.
</li></ul>

<p><strong>Customize Tabs:</strong> The first few sites to which you
belong have their own tabs in your navigation. To change the sites
that have their own tabs, or remove a site completely from your
navigation, click <strong><code>Customize Tabs</code></strong>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>You cannot have different preferences for individual
worksites. For example, if you change your Email Archive notification
to "daily digest", you will get a daily email message from each of the
sites to which you belong. Or, if you choose to block Announcements,
notifications about low priority announcements will be blocked for all
sites to which you belong.  <br /><br />
</li><li>High priority notifications cannot be blocked. If you send a high
priority notification, it is delivered immediately to all of your
site's participants.
</li></ul>
