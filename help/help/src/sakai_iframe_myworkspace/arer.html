<h2>Worksite Setup: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Worksite Setup tool provides information about the sites to
which you currently belong or may join. If you have a role that allows
it, you can use this tool to make changes to information about the
site, tools available in the site, and access to the site. You can
also publish the site using the Worksite Setup tool.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>Worksite Setup displays a list of sites to which you belong and/or
on which you can take some action, such as <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> or
<strong><code>Delete</code></strong>. If you lack appropriate permissions for a site, you
cannot edit it.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3> 

<ul><li>The functions of the Worksite Setup tool mirror those of the
Site Info tool; Worksite Setup
is available through <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, whereas Site Info is available in each
site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you don't have the appropriate permissions, in Worksite Setup
you will only see the information about the site published by the
owner.
</li></ul>
