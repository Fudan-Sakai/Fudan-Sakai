<h2>Options for adding attachments</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>When creating a new item, some tools give you the option to add
attachments. You can add any number of attachments, and they can be
any combination of local files, web sites, and items stored in
Resources. To add an attachment, follow the appropriate instructions
below:</p>

<ul><li>To attach a local file from your computer, next to "Upload local
file", click <strong><code>Browse</code></strong> to find and select the file on your
computer.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To attach a URL, next to "URL (link to website)", type
the URL in the box provided, and then click <strong><code>Add</code></strong>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You do not need to include the
<code>http://</code> when you type the URL.</p>
</li><li>To attach an item from Resources, under "Select a resource", click
<strong><code>Attach a copy</code></strong> next to the file you want to add.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can attach a file from one of your other
sites (including your <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> area), provided the
file's access properties are set to <strong><code>Display to non-members (publicly
viewable)</code></strong>. To browse for files in other sites, click <strong><code>Show
other sites</code></strong>.</p>
</li></ul>

<p>As you add attachments, they appear in a list under "Items to
attach". When you've selected all the files, web sites, and Resource
items you wish to attach, review the list, and then, at the bottom of
the screen, click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>. You should see all your items
listed under "Attachments".</p>
