<h2>Menubar: Overview</h2>












<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>In your site, the menubar is a customizable column along the left of
the screen that contains links to numerous collaborative tools. Site
leaders have permissions to add, edit, and delete tools with Site Info
or Worksite Setup.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Adding tools:</strong> A site participant with the
appropriate role can modify the content of the site's menubar by
adding or subtracting tools using the Site Info tool.</p>

<p>The site owner can choose to display (or hide) most tools in the
menubar.  Tools available may include the following, and possibly
additional tools. Your system administrator controls which tools are
available on your system. When new tools become available, or users'
needs change, your system administrator can add tools to the system,
and then they will appear in the list of tools that you can add to
your site.  </p>

<ul><li><strong>Home:</strong> This is the course or project site
home page. Home can contain a list of recent announcements, discussion
items, and chat messages. Also, participants can access Privacy

</li></ul>

<p>Site Info displays information about the site for site
participants. Site leaders can use this tool to add participants, edit
tools, manage groups, and import files. This tool is part of every
site and cannot be deleted from the menubar.</p>

 <p>The Help tool has support documentation for all the tools and can
contain links to other support resources.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>If your system allows it, create a practice site so that site
participants can familiarize themselves with the tools, functions, and
options.<br /><br />
</li><li>To avoid the accidental loss of resources, assign roles wisely.
Assign roles with broad permissions only to co-instructors and others
whom you can trust to edit your site. Everyone else should get a more
restricted role, allowing access but not site manipulation. For
instance, if another participant removes the Syllabus tool from your
site, it will irreversibly remove the syllabus information that you
stored there.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Users who visit the site will appear in the "Users Present" area
until they log out or until their session times out.
</li></ul>
