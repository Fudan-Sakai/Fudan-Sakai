<h2>Permissions and roles: Overview</h2>
<h3>What they do</h3>

<p>Permissions allow users to access certain features of a course or
project worksite, depending on their roles, and on the decisions made
by the site owner and the system administrator.</p>

<p>Roles are collections of permissions. Some roles allow users to
simply access or read content, while other roles allow for advanced
changes, such as adding participants, editing the site's content, and
changing permissions for other roles. </p>

<p>When you create a worksite, or when one is created for you, you 
have the role with the most permissions and the broadest level of
access.  You can choose (within the limits established by
the system administrator) which tools or functions (e.g., Forums,
Schedule, Resources) you want
the site to have. For many of these tools or functions, you can set
permissions that allow or prevent users from seeing or performing
certain tasks, depending on their roles.</p>

<p>For a summary of participant roles and how to find out what your role
is, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>. </p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p>Roles may vary in name, depending on the application. However, in
general, the creator of a <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a>, or the instructor
of a course site, has full permissions, and can add or delete content
within a worksite.</p>

<p>A user who joins an existing site has a more limited role. The
permissions of this role allow for interaction in the site (e.g., creating Chat messages), but do not allow for advanced tasks (e.g., uploading files into Resources or creating assignments).</p>

<p>However, each implementation of the application will be
different. System administrators can decide during implementation
which roles to install, and which permissions these roles will have.</p>

<h3>Things to remember</h3>

<ul><li>The availability of a tool in a worksite depends on the
particular implementation of the system administrator. If you have
broad rights to a worksite, and find that a tool is not available
through Site
Info, consult your administrator.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The Resources and Drop Box tools share the same permissions set. You can modify them in the Resources tool.  

<br /><br />
</li><li>Default roles have default permissions. These defaults
can be edited on the system level by the system administrator, and on
the worksite level by anyone with full permissions to the site.

<br /><br />
</li><li>All users are assigned the broadest role in their respective My
Workspaces to give them editing control.
</li></ul>
