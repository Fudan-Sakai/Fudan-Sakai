<h2>Changing permissions for a tool</h2> 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Permissions are generally granted for a tool, rather than for a particular
item created by using a tool. For example, permissions are set for the
Announcements tool, rather than for individual announcements.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
</p><ul><li>In Forums, there is no <strong><code>Permissions</code></strong> link for the whole
tool; instead, you can set permissions for individual forums and
topics. You can also edit the permissions in the default template that
will apply to any new forums or topics.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In Resources, you can set permissions for all resources and for
folders of resources.

<br /><br />
</li><li>The permissions for the Podcasts tool are shared with the
<code>Podcasts</code> folder in the Resources tool.  You can modify
them in either tool.  To modify the Podcasts permissions in Resources,
use the <strong><code>Actions</code></strong> menu next to the <code>Podcasts</code>
folder.


</li></ul>

<p>Most tools that contain individual instructor-created items, such as
Announcements or Schedule, have permission settings that you can
modify as described below.  In addition to the exceptions noted above,
some tools, including Syllabus, Messages, and Drop Box, do not allow you to
modify permissions.</p>

<p>To change permissions for most tools that allow permission editing:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant site, click the tool for
which you want to set permissions.

<br /><br /> 
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Permissions</code></strong> or <strong><code>Permission Settings</code></strong> at the
top of the main window.  

<br /><br />
</li><li>Check or uncheck the boxes to grant or deny the permissions.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must exit the permissions feature by
clicking <strong><code>Save</code></strong> or <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> before you can set
permissions in another tool.</p>

<p>Each tool has a different set of available permissions. For a general
idea of the permissions available, see the following list of
permissions for the Resources tool:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Create resources</strong></li><li><strong>Read resources</strong>
      </li><li><strong>Edit any resource</strong></li><li><strong>Edit own resources</strong></li><li><strong>Delete any resource</strong></li><li><strong>Delete own resources</strong></li><li><strong>Access/create group resources</strong></li><li><strong>Read hidden resources</strong>
</li></ul>
