Linktool is intended for calling external applications, e.g. written in PHP.
It requires the application to be able to do web services calls back to Sakai.
Other than that, it is very light-weight.

There are two modes: install as tool, and call via URL

SETUP

The first time you deploy this, two keys will be placed in the Linktool
configuration directory. This defaults to the Sakai home directory inside
tomcat (e.g. /usr/local/tomcat/sakai), as returned by 
ServerConfigurationService.getSakaiHomePath(). 

In clustered configurations, you will need to use the same key and salt on 
all app servers. To do this, specify a shared location which all app servers 
can read (and the first app server to start up can write to) using the 
sakai.properties setting linktool.home, e.g.

linktool.home=/data/sakai/config/

The file names are sakai.rutgers.linktool.privkey and sakai.rutgers.linktool.salt. 
The session authorization objects are signed with this key, and they 
should work on all systems. If you somehow lose these keys, new ones 
will be generated. This will invalidate all existing session authorization 
objects. You may actually want to delete the keys and recreate them now 
and then, to force everyone to reissue all of the session authorization objects.

LinkTool uses SakaiSigning.jws which is part of the sakai-axis webservices package
(webapps/sakai-axis). To enable Linktool's webservices, yuo need to specify the
sakai.properties setting

linktool.enabled=true

Note that you do not need to set webservices.allowlogin. That controls login
using the login function in SakaiLogin.jws.

If you want import from archive to work, in 
common/archive-impl/pack/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml
add to mergeFilteredSakaiServices
<value>LinkToolEntityProducer</value>

If you want to be able to copy linktools from an old site
to a new one, you'll need to make sure that linktool or some tool based
on it is not hidden, since the user will need to choose all tools that
they want copied.


INSTALL AS TOOL

Use this if you want your external application to look like any other
Sakai tool. If you simply deploy the tool, it will make itself available
to be enabled in sites. 

Once the tool is installed in a site, you must set at least one parameter, 
the URL. These parameters are most easily set via the setup screen. A Setup 
link appears at the top of the frame for any user who is allowed to update 
the site. 

The default URL is a verification script from samples/linktool.php running at

http://nightly2.sakaiproject.org/linktool/linktool.php

If your server is configured correctly, the script will display at the bottom:

"All correct - the verification request was authorized by the callback web service."

Here are the parameters you can set in Setup:

   url - required. This is the URL of your application. You may add
additional arguments to the URL, e.g.

http://some.domain/remoteapp.php?key1=value1&key2=value2

Linktool will add some arguments, as indicated below, and include a signature
for the entire URL.

   height - optional. This is a javascript height definition, which must
include a unit. It is the height of the window used for the application,
in pixels. It defaults to 600.

   page title - optional. This is not strictly speaking a parameter of
the tool. Entering data into this field will cause page on which the
tool has been installed to be renamed. ("Page title" is the label for
the tool which appears in the site's menubar, and at the top of the tool frame).

See below for how to preconfigure an instance of the tool so that site owners
don't need to fill in the url and height.

CALL VIA URL

Use this if you need to call the external application from a Sakai page.
This is typically used to add functionality to an existing Sakai tool.
The URL should look like this:

   https://YOURSITE/sakai-rutgers-linktool?site=XXXXXX&url=https://YOURAPP

XXXXXX is the ID of the site. Typically this will be supplied by the
Sakai page that has this URL. If your vm or jsp doesn't have access to
the site ID, it is possible to derive it from the current URL in
javascript.

https://yourapp is the URL of your application. You can include additional
arguments by adding them to the URL, e.g.

   https://YOURSITE/sakai-rutgers-linktool?site=XXXXXX&url=https://YOURAPP&key1=value1&key2=value2

Linktool will add some arguments, as indicated below.

HOW LINKTOOL CALLS YOUR APPLICATION

Linktool first derives some key information, which we believe all
applications are likely to need. It calls the URL you have
defined, with the following arguments:

  user - this is username. In fact, it is what Sakai calls the
"Enterprise ID." That is that user-visible version of the username.
There is also an internal version of the username, which is often a
unique generated object. Most applications won't want to use
it. However if a user changes their username, "user" will change,
while that internal name will not. When moving from versions older
than 2.2 to version 2.2 of Sakai, existing users will have an internal
name that is the same as their enterprise ID. However new users will
get a unique, generated internal name.
   The user information comes from the session.  If you
are using Linktool as a tool, Sakai will obviously know the current
username. If you are calling it as a URL, Sakai will look at your
Sakai session cookie, and pull the username out of the session.
Obviously this will only work if the current browser has already
logged into Sakai. 

  internaluser - this is the generated username mentioned above.
In the implementation for Sakai 2.1 this is always the same as user.

  site - If you are using Linktool as a tool, this is the user's
current site, which is the site in which Linktool is installed. If you
are calling it as a URL, you will need to pass the site name, as
indicated above. We verify that the user actually has access to the
site, to avoid spoofing.

  placement - If you are using Linktool as a tool, this is the tool's 
placement id, which is unique for each instance of the tool. This 
can be used to have more than one instance of Linktool in a site,
while still allowing remote applications to distinguish between the
instances. If called as a URL, placement is "none".

  role - This is the user's role in the site. It is a string, which
depends upon the roles configured for the site. Default role names
are Student, Teaching Assistant and Instructor for course sites, and
access and maintain for project sites. However, sites could have
different role names. If you're dealing with grading or other functions 
like that, it's probably safer to use isUserAbleToGradeStudent from 
SakaiGradebook.jws to check permissions. If the user is viewing the
site in a different role using the "View As" feature (see SAK-7924),
the role will be the user's effective role at the time, rather than
the user's permanent role in the site.

  session - This is an encrypted version of the session ID for the
current session. See below for how it is used.

  serverurl - This is the url to call back to the server. To be
secure, this must be SSL, and your software must check the certificate.
This is needed because PHP applications may talk to more than one
Sakai implementation. When you get a call, you'll need to talk to
web services on the specific Sakai server that called you.  This
URL is normally serverUrl in sakai.properties. However if necessary
you can override it using sakai.rutgers.linktool.serverUrl.

  time - internal Java ms time, used to prevent replays. You
must call testsign within 30 sec, or the check will fail.

  sign - This is a digital signature. This is necessary because
your application needs to be assured that the specified user has
actually logged in properly. Without this, anyone could go to your
site and claim to be any user. It is critical for you to check
the digital signature.

To check the digital signature, call testsign from SakaiSigning.jws.
Here is a sample call from PHP, with error processing omitted.

  require_once('SOAP/Client.php');
  $wsdl=new SOAP_WSDL("$url/SakaiSigning.jws?wsdl", array("timeout" => 360));
  if (!$wsdl)
     ....

  $myProxy=$wsdl->getProxy();
  if (!$myProxy)
    ....

  $result=$myProxy->testsign($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING']);
  if ($result != "success")
    ....

This code simply passes the entire list of arguments back to Sakai for
verification. Because your code doesn't do any processing of the
arguments, Linktool could change the digital signature technology without
requiring you to change your code.

Note by the way that a time stamp is included in the arguments. 
This protects against someone capturing a web transaction and
using it later. The argument list is only valid for 30 sec.

There are several web services implementations available for PHP. This
example uses the SOAP implementation for PEAR. PEAR is a system for
adding extensions to PHP. To use it, you must build PHP with PEAR
support (--with-pear). In addition to adding support to PHP, the PEAR
installation adds an executable program called "pear" to /usr/bin or
/usr/local/bin. This program is used to fetch and install PEAR
extensions. E.g. to install SOAP, you type "pear install SOAP". That
fetches SOAP over the network and installs it. See
http://pear.php.net/package/SOAP.

NOTE: sessions in Sakai timout after 60 min of inactivity by default.
If a user goes to an external application, and that application does
its own session management, Sakai will not know there's any
activity going on. Thus after 60 min, the Sakai session will time
out. If this is not desirable, you can periodically call
touchsession:

  $sessionid = strip_tags($_GET['session']);

  $result=$myProxy->touchsession($sessionid);
  if ($result != "success")
    ....

Session is passed to your application in the initial call. It is 
an encrypted version of a Sakai session id. touchsession will
make Sakai reset the inactivity timer. Note that you can pass
touchsession a list of encrypted session ID's, separated by commas.
That will allow a large-scale application to update multiple
sessions at once, thus improving efficency.

You may wonder why we pass an encrypted session ID. Passing a user's
session ID would allow a remote application access to all of the user's
information in all sites that the user belonged to, which is not 
something that untrusted applications should be able to do (for
example, in the U.S. it could lead to violations of FERPA privacy 
restrictions).


CODING STANDARDS

The code to set up the proxy, i.e.

  $wsdl=new SOAP_WSDL("$url/SakaiSigning.jws?wsdl", array("timeout" => 360));
  $myProxy=$wsdl->getProxy();

is fairly expensive. If possible, you should this once for each .jws
file you're going to use, and save the wsdl structure globally for use
in all calls to that jws file.

Also, creating sessions is fairly expensive. You should avoid doing
getsession any more often than necessary. The first time a user connects 
to your application, you should get all the necessary sessions, and 
store their IDs in the PHP session.

If you use the same privileged user for all sessions, consider
getting a single session for that privileged user, and saving it for
use everywhere. However sessions do not necessarily last forever, so
if you get any errors, you can do checkSession(id) from
SakaiSession.jws. It will return either a string describing the
attributes of the session, or "Session Null". If you get Session Null,
you will have to try reestablishing the session.

Note that the session privilege objects are only valid for a
specific Sakai installation. Consider keeping your session authorization 
objects in a data structured that is indexed by Sakai site. 
Then you will only present an authorization object to the site it 
applies to. This is necessary to avoid having a rogue site find out 
authorization objects for another site.


PRECONFIGURING AN INSTANCE OF THE TOOL

The instructions above are intended for site owners to use the tool on
an ad hoc basis to go a site they maintain. If you have external tools
that are used regularly, you will probably want to create an instance
of the Link Tool that is preconfigured to go to that external tool.
Then site owners can install it just like any other Sakai tool, and not
have to worry about configuring it.

To do this, you will need to edit src/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml, and add
a file in src/webapp/tools/. If you rebuild and redeploy Sakai,
the new instance will be added to the site tools menu.

[This is done automatically by "maven sakai", for the web server that
maven knows about. For other web servers, do "maven sakai" and then
copy the new version of sakai-rutgers-linktool.war on top of the
existing one in the webapp directory of the server. If you don't
want to do a full redeploy, you can add the new .xml file to
webapp/tools and then update web.xml. Make sure you do it in that
order. Changing web.xml will cause Sakai to reload the context.]

src/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml: You need to duplicate the existing
filter-mapping and servlet declarations. E.g. if you want to add
a tool "testlink" you might add the following:

    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>sakai.request</filter-name>
        <servlet-name>sakai.rutgers.testlink</servlet-name>
        <dispatcher>REQUEST</dispatcher>
        <dispatcher>FORWARD</dispatcher>
        <dispatcher>INCLUDE</dispatcher>
    </filter-mapping>

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>sakai.rutgers.testlink</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.sakaiproject.tool.rutgers.LinkTool</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
    </servlet>

These are identical to the original declarations, except that the
servlet name has been changed.

Now you need to add a file sakai.rutgers.testlink.xml. The name
should be the same as the servlet name you used above, with .xml
added to the end. You can start with sakai.rutgers.linktool.xml,
and change the things you need. E.g.

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<registration>

	<tool
			id="sakai.rutgers.testlink"
			title="Test Link"
			description="A test of the link tool.">

		<configuration name="url" value="https://rulink.rutgers.edu/testlink.php" />
		<configuration name="height" value="600px" />
                <category name="course" />
                <category name="project" />

		<keyword name="linktool" />

	</tool>

</registration>

Note these changed parameters:

  id - must match the servlet name used in web.xml

  title - this is the title for the tool that will appear in the
site menubar (left margin) when someone adds it to the site

  description - this will appear in the Site Info or Worksite Setup 
tools menu to describe the tool

  url and height - as above; points to the external tool

  category - these declarations allow it in both course and
project sites. You can remove one or both. If you remove both, an
administrator will need to add it to the site (unless you give
users access to site editor).

  keyword - must be "linktool". This is how the site export,
import and copy code figures out which tools need to use
linktool's code.


ACCESSING SAKAI SESSIONS FROM YOUR APPLICATION

Most applications will need to use web services for some purpose, e.g.
adding grades to a gradebook. Most web services calls require a
session ID. Most calls will only let you do what the owner of the
session can do. Thus we need a way for applications to get access
to sessions owned by a variety of people:

 * the site owner, to do things like grading
 * an administrator, to create users and sites, or to do grading for
   lots of sites
 * the currently logged in user, to find out things about the user do
   things on their behalf.

Thus Link Tool provides a web services call "getsession". It creates a 
session and returns the ID of that session.

The problem is how to verify that the application has the rights to
create a session for a specific purpose. For that Link Tool provides signed
session privilege objects.  Here's a typical object:

  user=hedrick&sign=16e....

If you present this object to getsession, it will create a session
owned by hedrick. sign= is a digital signature, which verifies that
the object is authorized.  There's currently one other form of 
session privilege object:

  currentuser&sign=78a10...

This indicates that a session should be created for the current end
user.

There are two forms of call to getsession

  $result=$myProxy->getsession($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'], $obj);
  $result=$myProxy->getsession($obj);

where $obj is one of the session privilege objects. 

In clustered configurations where Sakai is running behind a load balancer, 
the session returned is only valid for a specific application server. To 
ensure that subsequent calls by applications use the application server on 
which the session is valid, either configure the load-balancer to use 
IP-address-based load balancing for calls to /sakai-axis/ webservices, or 
if individual application servers can be accessed through direct URLs 
bypassing the load balancer, use these forms of getsession which return a 
comma-separated session id and server URL. The server URL should be used for
subsequent webservices calls using the given session id.

  $result=$myProxy->getSessionToServer($_SERVER['QUERY_STRING'], $obj);
  $result=$myProxy->getSessionToServer($obj);

These methods require the sakai.properties setting webservices.directurl
to be configured for each application server (for example in local.properties).
See http://jira.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-14335 and 
http://jira.sakaiproject.org/jira/browse/SAK-13393 for more details.

If you supply the query string it is checked, except that the time is not 
checked. That's because this operation might reasonably be done long after
the initial connection (e.g. at the end when you're about to report
grades). At that point the time might be past. For this reason,
you should always do testsign at the beginning, even if you're going
to do getsession with both arguments.

The only time you need to pass the query string is when the object is
of the form "currentuser..." In that case we need to know who the
current user is. That comes from the initial query string.

If $result is a string, it will be a session ID. Errors result in Axis
error objects, which are not simple strings.

Currently anyone who can get into the setup mode of Link Tool can  
generate a session privilege object for themselves.

This should allow people to do small-scale applications that access
sites that they own. Link Tool does not permit them to generate objects
for other users, or currentuser objects. Those would permit them to
compromise the privacy of other users.

Admin-equivalent users have the ability to generate session privilege 
objects for any user, and for currentuser, in the Link Tool Setup page.

Currentuser should only be given to applications that you trust, since 
it allows the application to become any user for which the application 
can present a valid query string. Potentially that could be any user 
that has ever used the application.
