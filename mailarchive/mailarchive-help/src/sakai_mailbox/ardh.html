<h2>Email Archive: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Each site has an automatically generated site email address, which you
can view via the Email Archive tool. Email you send to the site email
address is copied to the email addresses of all site participants and
owners.  All email messages sent to your site's email address are
stored in the Email Archive.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Mail alias:</strong> Site owners can create an
easy-to-remember alias for the site's email address. To set up the
alias, from within Email Archive, click <strong><code>Options</code></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Email frequency:</strong> Site members can use
<strong><code>Preferences</code></strong> in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> to choose how often
they want to receive email sent to the site's email address: either as
it is sent, or in digest mode, with all posts for the day sent in a
single email message.  See <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send mail to
particular individuals. Mail sent to your site's email address is
received by all site participants. To send messages to individual
participants or a group, use the Messages tool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.</p>

</li><li>


</li><li>You can use any email program to send mail to the
email address listed at the top of your Email Archive page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Clicking a column header (<strong><code>From</code></strong>, <strong><code>Subject</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Date Received</code></strong>) will sort the email messages by that header.
Click the header again to reverse the order.  <br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses links to handle attachments. Instead of
receiving an attachment directly in the body of an email message, you
can click a link to view the attachment. This feature helps prevent
you from going over quota. Messages sent to site participants
indicate if there is an attachment.</li></ul>
