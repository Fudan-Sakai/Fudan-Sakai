<h2>Sending and receiving email using Email
Archive</h2>

<p>The Email Archive gives your site its own email address that
participants can use for communicating with each other. When you first
access the site, if you don't see the <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong> tool on
the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, you will need to add it. See <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.</p>



<h3>Sending email messages</h3>

<p>You can send email to your site's participants from your email
account, just as you would to any other email address. All email messages
will be stored in the Email Archive and visible to all
participants. To view your site's email address, in the menubar, click
<strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>. For more, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arew">Sending and receiving mail using Email Archive</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send mail to
particular individuals. Mail sent to your site's email address is
received by all site participants. To send messages to individual
participants or a group, use the Messages tool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.</p>


<h3>Receiving email messages</h3> 

<p>Email Archive messages are sent to the email address listed under
"Account" in My Workspace. You do not need to log into the
application to read your mail. However, if you do not wish to receive
mail from the site, or if you'd rather receive mail in a daily digest
format, you can change your notification preferences from <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>
