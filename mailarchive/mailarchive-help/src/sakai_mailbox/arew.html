<h2>Sending and receiving mail using Email
Archive</h2>
<p>The Email Archive gives your site its own email address that
participants can use to send mail to all site members. Site owners
can choose the add the tool, if it is not present by default, and to
customize the address to make it easier to remember; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.</p>



<h3>Sending email messages</h3>

<p>To send mail to all members of your site:</p>

<ol><li>If you don't already know the email address for the site, in the
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of your site, click <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>.

<p>On the Email Archive screen, under "Email sent to the following
addresses will be archived and sent to participants", you'll see the
site email address. </p>

<p>Above the site address, you'll see a message telling you if you are
authorized to send email. If this site is set up to accept mail only
from site participants (see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ares">Customizing an Email Archive</a>),
you will also see the address from which you are authorized to send
email; use this account to send messages to the site address. </p>
</li><li>Send email to your site's participants from your email
account, just as you would to any other email address. 
</li></ol>

<p>Mail messages will go directly to the email addresses of all participants
in your site, and will also be visible to all participants in the
Email Archive within your site, for later reference.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send mail to
particular individuals. Mail sent to your site's email address is
received by all site participants. To send messages to individual
participants or a group, use the Messages tool; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending, forwarding, and replying to messages</a>.</p>


<h3>Receiving email messages</h3> 





<p>Email Archive messages are sent to the email address listed under
"Account" in My Workspace. You do not need to log into the
application to read your mail. However, if you do not wish to receive
mail from the site, or if you'd rather receive mail in a daily digest
format, you can change your notification preferences from <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My
Workspace</a>. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>
