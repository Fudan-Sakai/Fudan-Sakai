However, only Sakai system administrator(s) can publish a form globally (that is, across all sites in Sakai). </p><p>To request that a form be published globally, access the Forms tool and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>If the Forms home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li><li>Find the form you want to submit to the system administrator for global publication. </li><li>Click the Publish Global link for the form. Sakai displays this confirmation screen:</li><li>To proceed with the request, click Yes. Sakai displays the Forms home page. The Global State for this form has been changed to "waiting for approval." Or, to return to the home page without submitting the request, click No. </li></ol></div></body></html>
