Each form that you create for the site is based on an .xml schema definition (.xsd file). This file is stored in Resources.</p><p><i>Important:</i> We strongly recommend that you store all .xsd files in My Workspace Resources rather than in the portfolio site's Resources area. Site participants do not need to work with or see these files. By storing .xsd files in your personal Resources area (preferably in a folder named Form .xsds or something similar), you prevent site participants from possibly being confused by them. This practice leaves the site Resources area free to be used as the place for files that are appropriate for all site participants. It also allows you to use a single copy of an .xsd file in your My Workspace Resources to create forms in all of your sites.</p><p>All forms are also stored in Resources, so users access them via the Resources tool. In Resources, the name of each local form is displayed along with the name of the site to which it belongs in parentheses. So, a form entitled "Education" that is used only in the Career Services site is listed in Resources as Education (Career Services). </p><p>Using the Forms tool, you import .xsd files from Resources, give them meaningful names, provide instructions for using them, create the forms, and publish them for use by site participants. You may also use this tool to export forms from one site and import them into another. </p><p>The Forms tool does not provide direct access to the forms you create. Instead, site participants access forms that they need to complete via the Resources tool. They may view completed forms in Resources and in the wizards, matrices, and portfolios that make use of these forms. When users access the part of the wizard, matrix, or portfolio that contains a form, the form will display automatically.</p></div></body></html>
