<h2>Forums: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>


<p>The Forums tool allows instructors or site leaders to create an
unlimited number of discussion forums, and is integrated closely with
other tools such as Resources and Gradebook.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Grading option:</strong> Interactions can be assigned a point
value and sent to the Gradebook with comments.</p>

<p><strong>Counts of unread posts at a glance:</strong> On your site's
Home page (select <strong><code>Home</code></strong> on the site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>), you
can see how many unread messages or posts you have in both Messages
and Forums.  From <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>, you can see these totals
for all sites you're a member of.</p>

<p><strong>Ability to watch forums:</strong> Site members can elect to
receive no email notification, notification for all new postings in a site,
or notification for responses to threads they've posted in.  </p>

<p><strong>Composing messages:</strong> A WYSIWYG (What You
See Is What You Get) interface allows rich text, plain text, and
HTML editing. You can add attachments to any message by
linking to files or web links in Resources.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pasting text from Microsoft Word directly into
the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">WYSIWYG editor</a> may result in garbled output, even if the text
appears correct in the editor.  Instead, to insert formatted text from
a Word document, click the <strong><code>Paste from Word</code></strong> icon, and paste
using <code>Ctrl-v</code> or <code>Command-v</code>.  </p>

<p>Some users have reported problems using <strong><code>Paste from Word</code></strong> in
Internet Explorer 9; for best results, use a supported
browser.  See
<a href="content.hlp?docId=asxg">Which browser should I use?</a></p>



<p><strong>Quoted text:</strong> Use the <strong><code>Insert Original Text</code></strong>
option to insert the previous post into your response.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics:</strong> Forum statistics are available for
site owners to determine the participation level of individual
participants.  You can also read all of a particular participant's
posts using this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Settings:</strong> The site owner (or another participant
with the appropriate role) can enable participants to submit their
posts to a topic before they have permission to read the responses of
others.</p>

<p><strong>Group awareness:</strong> Site leaders can change forum and
topic settings in combination with predefined groups to allow or deny
access to specific discussions per group.</p>

<p><strong>Direct link to individual messages:</strong> Site leaders
can copy a direct link to individual messages to use elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Email the author of a message:</strong> Site leaders can
directly email the author of a posting from within the forum tool.</p>
