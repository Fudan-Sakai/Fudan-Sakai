<h3>Creating a forum</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>A default forum and topic is populated for each site.  To create a new
forum:</p>

<ol><li>In your site's <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Forums</code></strong>. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top, click <strong><code>New Forum</code></strong>. The <code>Forum
Settings</code> screen will open.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Forum Title" field, type your forum's title. 

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Short Description" field, you can provide a brief
description (limited to 255 characters) that will be displayed along
with the title in the Forums area.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In the "Description" field, you can enter an in-depth description
of your forum, and provide any associated information or
resources.






<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Attachments", you can attach a file from your local
computer or from Resources, or specify the address for a file on the
web. For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aupf">Options for adding attachments</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To disable forum postings, under "Forum Posting", select
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> next to "Lock Topic (Disable forum
postings)". <strong><code>No</code></strong> is selected by default, allowing site
participants to post messages.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To moderate forum postings, under "Forum Posting", select
<strong><code>Yes</code></strong> next to "Moderate Topics in Forum".  <strong><code>No</code></strong> is
selected by default, allowing site participants to post messages
without moderation.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Availability", you can choose to
display the forum immediately or to specify availability dates.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To automatically mark all messages in a thread as read at one
time, under "Mark Threads Read", select <strong><code>Yes</code></strong> next to
"Automatically Mark All Messages in a Thread as Read".  With this
setting, each time you open the first message in a thread, all
messages within that thread are automatically marked as read. The
default setting is <strong><code>No</code></strong>, which tracks read/unread status for
each message individually. (With the default thread, you can also
manually click <strong><code>Mark All as Read</code></strong> for a given thread.)
</li><li>
<p>Under "Permissions", you can modify permission levels for
participant roles (and groups, if you've created them; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atcs">Managing groups</a>). To do so, from the drop-down list next
to "This site role:", select a role (or group) for editing by clicking its
name. Then, next to "gets this permission level:", use the drop-down list to
select from several predefined permission levels. Additionally, you
can create custom permission levels by clicking to enable or disable
the following functions:</p>
 
<ul><li><strong>New Forum:</strong> Create a new forum. You can modify this
option only via Template Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Topic:</strong> Create a new topic. You can modify
this option only via Template Settings or Forum Settings.
</li><li><strong>New Response:</strong> Create a new response to your
topic.
</li><li><strong>Response to Response:</strong> Send responses to a topic
response.
</li><li><strong>Post to Gradebook:</strong> Grade responses and add
comments. Send grades and comments to Gradebook.
</li><li><strong>Change Settings:</strong> Change the topic settings.
</li><li><strong>Read:</strong> Read topic responses.
</li><li><strong>Mark as Read:</strong> Mark messages as read.
</li><li><strong>Moderate Postings:</strong> Moderate messages posted to
forum (available if "Moderate Topics in Forum" option was selected
above).
</li><li><strong>Edit Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
revise (none, their own, or all postings).
</li><li><strong>Delete Postings:</strong> Use the radio buttons to
indicate which postings participants with the permission level can
delete (none, their own, or all postings).

  </li></ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Forum permission settings will apply to all 
subsequently created topics in that forum, but if you modify forum
permission settings after topics have been created, you must change
the topic permission settings separately.</p>

</li><li>Next to "Gradebook Item", use the drop-down list to choose
an item with which the forum should be associated.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To add an item to the
Gradebook, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aran">Adding, editing, or deleting a Gradebook item</a>.</p>
</li><li>When you're finished, click one of the following:

<br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>Save:</strong> Save your changes. 
</li><li><strong>Save Settings &amp; Add Topic:</strong> Save your changes
and add a topic to your forum. 
</li><li><strong>Save Draft:</strong> Save your forum as a draft. Forums

</li><li><strong>Cancel:</strong> Cancel your changes.
</li></ul>
