            <h2>Changing a Style</h2>
            				
            <p>If you are a site organizer, you may change the name and description of any style you have created that has not been published.
               You may also choose a different .css file for any unpublished style. After a style has been published, only the system administrator
               can change it. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>To change a style, access the Styles tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Styles home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the style you want to change and click the Revise link below its name. Sakai displays the Revise Style screen. The boxes
                  on this screen show your current entries for this style. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>Change entries as needed. </li>
               					
               <li>To save your changes, click Save Changes. Sakai saves the changes you have entered and displays the Styles home page. Or,
                  to return to that page without saving your changes, click Cancel.
               </li>
