            <h2>Deleting a Style</h2>
            				
            <p>If you are a site organizer, you may delete a style if it meets these conditions:</p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>It has not yet been published. After a style has been published, only the system administrator can delete it.</li>
               					
               <li>It is not being used in any portfolio or portfolio template on the site. If a style is in use, you must delete all portfolios
                  and templates that use it before deleting the style. 
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            				
            <p>To delete a style, access the Styles tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Styles home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the style you want to remove and click the Delete link below its name. Sakai displays a delete confirmation window. </li>
               					
               <li>To delete the style, click OK. Sakai deletes the style and displays the Styles home page. Or, to return to the home page without
                  deleting this style, click Cancel. 
               </li>
