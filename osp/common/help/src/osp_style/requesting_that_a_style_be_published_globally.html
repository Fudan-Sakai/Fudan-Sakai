            <h2>Requesting that a Style Be Published Globally</h2>
            				
            <p>If you have created a style that has general applicability, you may want to make it available for use in all sites in your
               CLE. However, only Sakai system administrator(s) can publish a style globally (that is, across all sites in Sakai). 
            </p>
            				
            <p>To request that a style be published globally, access the Styles tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Styles home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the style you want to suggest for global publication. </li>
               					
               <li>Click the Suggest for global publish link below the name of the style. Sakai submits the style for consideration for global
                  publication and displays the Styles home page again. 
               </li>
               				
            </ol>
