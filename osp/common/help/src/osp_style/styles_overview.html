            <h2>Styles: Overview</h2>
            				
            <p>Styles are sets of fonts, colors, and graphics. Site organizers use styles to control the look of matrix cells, wizards, and
               wizard pages. Site participants use them to control the look of templates they design themselves.
            </p>
            				
            <p>
               <i>Guidelines for Using Styles</i> In order to maintain consistency within a matrix or wizard, we recommend that you, the site organizer, apply the same style
               to all cells in the matrix or all pages of the wizard. Portfolios do not necessarily require this consistency. Site participants
               who design their own portfolios may want to use more than one style. These users find it most helpful to have a variety of
               styles available for their work. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>If you are a site organizer, you use the Styles tool to "create" a style by uploading a cascading style sheet (that is, a
               .css file) from Resources, giving it a meaningful name, and (if desired) providing a description of it. This tool also allows
               you to change the name and description of an existing style, delete a style you no longer need, and change usage permissions
               of all users in any role. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>Once a style has been created in a site or globally using the Portfolio Admin site, the style is available for all members
               of the site to use.
            </p>
            				
            <p>The Styles tool is usually located in the Design &amp; Publish category of a Portfolo site. To access the tool, click the Launch
               button for Styles. The CLE displays the Styles home page.
            </p>
            				
            <p>This page contains a list of all styles on the site that you have created and that have been published for others to use.
               For each style in the list, you can see a description, the name of the person who created the style, and whether it has been
               suggested for publication. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>If the list is longer than one page, use the buttons under the Styles menu bar to display other pages. </p>
