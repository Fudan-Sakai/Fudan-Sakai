            <p>Creating a matrix involves multiple steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>Creating a framework for the matrix.</li>
               					
               <li>Setting up the cells.</li>
               					
               <li>Publishing the matrix.</li>
               				
            </ol>
            				
            <h3>Step 1: Creating the Framework</h3>
            				
            <p>To create the framework for a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>In the Matrices menu bar near the top of the screen, click the Add button. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen.</li>
               					
               <li>In the appropriate boxes, enter a title for the matrix and a description of its purpose. Only the Title entry is required.
                  
                  <i>Caution: Choose the title carefully. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change its title.</i>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>Choose one of the following options:</li>
               					
               <ul>
                  						
                  <li>To apply Sakai's default style to this matrix, skip this step and proceed directly to step 6. </li>
                  						
                  <li>To apply another style to this matrix, click Select Style. Sakai displays the Manage Styles screen. </li> This screen lists the styles available for use in your matrices. 
               </ul>
               					
               <li>Click the Select link for the style you want to apply to this matrix. Sakai redisplays the Add Matrix screen. The name of
                  the style you chose is displayed in the Style box. Or, to return to that screen without selecting a style, click Go Back.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add a column, click Add Column. Sakai displays the Editing Scaffold Column screen.</li>
               					
               <li>In the Name box, enter a name for display in the column header. Keep in mind that shorter names for columns allow for better
                  use of screen space.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To select a background color for this column other than the default (gray), click the color palette icon for the Background
                  Color box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the background color you want. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To select a color for the text in this column other than the default (black), click the color palette icon for the Font Color
                  box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the text color you want. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To save your work on this column, click Update. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen, including information for the column
                  you have just created. Or to return to the Add Matrix screen without adding this column, click Cancel.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Repeat steps 6 - 10 as needed to create the remaining columns for your matrix. 
                  <i>Caution: Think carefully about the number of columns in the matrix. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change the number
                     of columns it contains.
                  </i>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>To change terminology to something other than the word "Column," enter the term you prefer in the Column Label box.</li>
               					
               <li>To add a row, click Add Row. Sakai displays the Editing Scaffold Row screen.</li>
               					
               <li>In the Name box, enter a name for display in the row header.</li>
               					
               <li>To select a background color for this row other than the default (gray), click the color palette icon for the Background Color
                  box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the background color you want. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To select a color for the text in this row other than the default (black), click the color palette icon for the Font Color
                  box. When Sakai displays color choices, click the text color you want. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To save your work on this row, click Update. Sakai displays the Add Matrix screen, including information for the row you have
                  just created. Or to return to the Add Matrix screen without adding this row, click Cancel. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>Repeat steps 13 - 17 as needed to create the remaining rows for the matrix. 
                  <i>Caution: Think carefully about the number of rows in the matrix. After publishing a matrix, you cannot change the number of
                     rows it contains.

               </li>
               					
               <li>To change terminology to something other than the word "Row," enter the term you prefer in the Row Label box.</li>
               					
               <li>Under Matrix Presentation, click the appropriate radio button to select the way you want participants to work through the
                  cells in the matrix.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Under Matrix Status Colors, select colors to indicate the status of each cell in the matrix.

            <p>To set up cells for a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the matrix you want to work on and click the Revise link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen. </li>

                     <li>Sakai displays the Revise Cell screen. </li>
                     							
                     <li>Sakai has automatically entered a title for this cell. The default title includes the name of both the column and row that
                        intersect at this cell. 
                     </li>

               </li>
               					
               <li>Change the title of the cell, if needed. An entry in the Title box is required. </li>
               					
               <li>Enter a description (objectives, etc.) of the cell, if needed. </li>
               					
               <li>In the Initial Status box, select either Ready or Locked to indicate whether this cell is to be available to participants
                  as soon as the matrix is published. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To apply a style to this cell, see "Step 1: Creating the Framework," step 4, above.</li>
               					
               <li>Add the following as needed:</li>

                  <li>Forms for structuring reviewer feedback on participant work in this cell.</li>
                  						
                  <li>Forms for evaluation of work after this cell has been submitted for evaluation.</li>
                  						
                  <li>Names of evaluators</li>
                  					
               </ul>
               					
               <li>To save your work, click Save Changes. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen. Or, to return to this screen without saving
                  your entries, click Cancel.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To set up other cells in the matrix, repeat steps 3- 9. </li>
               				
            </ol>
            				
            <h3>Step 3: Publishing the Matrix</h3>
            				
            <p>Publishing a matrix makes it available for use by site participants. To publish a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow
               these steps:
            </p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the matrix you want to work on and click the Publish link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Revise Matrix screen.
                  
               </li>
               					
               <li>To publish the matrix, click Continue. Sakai publishes the matrix and displays the Matrices home page. Or, to return to the
                  home page without publishing the matrix, click Cancel. 
               </li>
