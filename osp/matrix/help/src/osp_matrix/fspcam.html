            <h2>Completing a Matrix</h2>
            				
            <p>A matrix is a table of columns and rows that contains a customized collection of instructions, forms, files, and other materials.
               The purpose of these materials is to guide you through learning activities. These activities often take place over a long
               period of time. Therefore, you may need to access a matrix many times in order to complete it.
            </p>
            				
            <p>To complete part of a matrix (each part of the table is called a "cell"), you access it online, follow the instructions you
               find there, record information and attach requested materials, reflect on your activities, and receive feedback. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>After collecting samples of your work in a matrix, Sakai allows you to create a portfolio to showcase them. To access a matrix
               and work in one or more of its cells, access the Matrices tool and follow these steps:
            </p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Click the name of the matrix you want to work with. Sakai displays the matrix you have chosen.The name of the matrix is shown
                  in the upper left corner of the table. The intersection of each column and row forms a cell. Within each cell are instructions
                  for you to follow in order to demonstrate a specific level of competence in a particular area.
                  <br></br> As shown in the legend beneath the table, each cell is color coded to indicate its status.
                  <br></br>
                  						
                  <ul>
                     							
                     <li>Ready: This cell is available for you to work on.</li>

            <p>After a cell has been evaluated, it returns to the "ready" color or changes to the "completed" color. Cells that return to
               the "ready" color require you to perform additional work and resubmit. Cells that are "completed" are not available to you

            <h3>Viewing Feedback on Your Work</h3>
            				
            <p>One or more members of the site may be assigned to review matrix cells and provide feedback on the work done in them by site
               participants. These reviewers may complete a feedback form for any cell that has not yet been submitted. If feedback has been
               offered for one of your matrix cells, you will notice a completed feedback form listed in the cell. To read the feedback you
               have received, follow these steps:
