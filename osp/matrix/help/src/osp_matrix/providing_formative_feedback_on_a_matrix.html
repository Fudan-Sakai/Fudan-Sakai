            <h2>Providing Formative Feedback</h2>
            				
            <p>If you are a reviewer, you may review the cells of a site participant's matrix at any time and offer formative feedback on
               the work you find there. You may also return to a cell you have reviewed before, review any further work that has been done
               there, and provide additional feedback. To review and provide feedback on a matrix, access the Matrices tool and follow these
               steps:
            </p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Matrices home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the matrix you want to review and click its name. Sakai displays the Manage Matrix screen. The screen displays the matrix.
                  In the upper left corner of the screen, a dropdown list is displayed.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Use the dropdown list to select the name of the person whose matrix you want.</li>
               					
               <li>Click Go. Sakai displays a read-only copy of the matrix for the user you specified. Icons in a cell indicate that the user
                  has attached material to it. The background color of a cell indicates its status. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To review the contents of a cell, click on it. Sakai displays the cell.</li>
               					
               <li>To review an attached item, click its name. </li>
               					
               <li>To enter feedback on the work in this cell, click the Add Feedback link in the "Feedback" section. Sakai displays a screen
                  that contains a feedback form. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>Enter comments in the Comments box, and then add a title for your feedback (required) and, if desired, a description. </li>
               					
               <li>Under "Access," click a radio button to specify whether the feedback is for public display, for display only to site members,
                  or neither. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add your feedback, click Add. Sakai displays the contents of the cell again. The title of your feedback is shown in the
                  Feedback section of the screen. 
               </li>
               					
               <li> To return to the matrix display, click Back to the Matrix.</li>
