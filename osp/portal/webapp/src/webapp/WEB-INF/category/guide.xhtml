            This area includes tools where a CIG Coordinator can provide guidance to you by creating forms for collection of data with rich text instruction, rationale and examples, which may include attachments. Once Coordinators have created forms, they can arrange them into a sequential, hierarchical or matrix type wizard to facilitate your completion of multiple forms. Coordinators may also create pre-defined portfolio templates, layouts and styles for you to use when creating a Portfolio. If some of the terminology Coordinators are using is new to you, they can add the term and definition to the glossary for your consumption.
