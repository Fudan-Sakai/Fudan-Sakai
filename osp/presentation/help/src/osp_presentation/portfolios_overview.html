            <h2>Portfolios - Overview</h2>
            				
            <p>An electronic portfolio is a collection of one or more web pages that presents information of your choosing and allows you
               to share it with others. Portfolios serve real-world purposes, such as career development and job search, documentation of
               and reflection on experience and learning, and collaboration. For example, you might create a portfolio for your resume or
               curriculum vita. You might also make a portfolio to showcase art, writing, or other talents and skills you have developed.
               Other uses of portfolios include collaboratively reporting on group projects and presenting learning you have demonstrated
               in matrices or wizards. These are just a few of the many ways people have used online portfolios. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>To create and work with a portfolio in Sakai, you use both the Resources tool and the Portfolios tool. First, you collect
               the material you want to present in Resources. Then you use the Portfolios tool to present the information.
            </p>
            				
            <p>The Portfolios tool allows you to do all of the following:</p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>Choose material for your presentation by selecting forms, matrices, uploaded files, and URLs from your Resources.</li>
               					
               <li>Design your own portfolio presentation by selecting from layouts and text/color/display styles made available to you by your
                  institution. Alternatively, you may base your presentation on a template made available to you by your institution. Templates
                  are especially helpful for more elaborate portfolios.
               </li>
               				
            </ul>
            				
            <p>At your institution, some styles, layouts, and templates may be available only to a specific site, while others are available
               to all sites. Therefore, users working in different sites may have access to different styles, layouts, and templates.
            </p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>Publish portfolio presentations for audiences of your choosing. Your audience may include both site participants and people
                  who are not members of the site.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Notify others that a portfolio has been shared with them.</li>
               					
               <li>Change, comment on, and delete your portfolios. </li>
               					
               <li>Invite comments on your portfolios and view and manage comments received. </li>
               					
               <li>View and comment on other participants' portfolios. View comments you have made about these portfolios.</li>
               					
               <li>View statistics on who has accessed your portfolios.</li>
               					
               <li>Download a copy of a portfolio to your desktop.</li>
