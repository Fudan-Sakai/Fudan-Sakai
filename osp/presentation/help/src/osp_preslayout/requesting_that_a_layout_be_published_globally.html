            <h2>Requesting that a Layout Be Published Globally</h2>
            			
            <p>If you have created a layout that has general applicability, you may want to make it available for use in all sites in your
               CLE. However, only Sakai system administrator(s) can publish a layout globally (that is, across all sites in Sakai). 
            </p>
            			
            <p>To request that a layout be published globally, access the Portfolio Layouts tool and follow these steps:</p>
            			
            <ol>
               				
               <li>If the Portfolio Layouts home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               				
               <li>Find the layout you want to suggest for global publication. </li>
               				
               <li>Click the Suggest for Global Publish link below the name of the layout. Sakai submits the layout for consideration for global
                  publication and displays the Portfolio Layouts home page again. 
               </li>
               			
            </ol>
            			
         </div>
      </div>
