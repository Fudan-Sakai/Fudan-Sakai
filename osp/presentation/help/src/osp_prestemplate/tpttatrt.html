            <p>If you are a site organizer, the Portfolio Templates tool allows you to add templates that define the content, style, and
               layout of portfolios created by your site participants. Each template is based on an .xsl file and may include other files,
               such as .css, .xsd, and javascript files. You must upload these files to Resources to make them available to the Portfolio
               Templates tool. 
            </p>
            				
            <p>After adding a template, you may use this tool to perform any of the following activities.</p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>Change, and delete it. </li>
               					
               <li>Publish it so site participants can use it. </li>
               					
               <li>Create a new template by copying the template you added and changing the copy. </li>
               					
               <li>Use a template created in one site in another site by exporting it from the first site and importing it into the other.</li>
               					
               <li>Change Portfolio Templates tool permissions for all users in any given role.</li>
