               <li>Click the Add button on the menu bar. Sakai displays the Add screen.</li>
               					
               <li>Select the type of wizard you are creating by clicking the button for either sequential or hierarchical. </li>
               					
               <li>To proceed, click Continue. Or, to return to the Wizards home page without creating a wizard, click Cancel.</li> If you clicked Continue, Sakai displays the Add Wizard, Step 1, screen. 
               <li>Using the boxes shown, enter a name, a description of the wizard's purpose, and keywords. Only the Name entry is required.

               <li>Choose one of the following options: 
                  <ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Adding Wizard Support</h3>
            				
            <p>At this point, you need to add information and forms that apply to the wizard as a whole. To do so, follow these steps:</p>

               <li>To add instructions and other helpful information for users, click Add Instructions. Sakai displays the Guidance screen.</li>

                     <li>Enter text directly into the text box on the screen. Use the icons and pulldown lists to format the text as appropriate.</li>
                     							
                     <li>Attach a file by clicking Select Items. To do so, follow the instructions given for selecting an item. After you click Finish,
                        Sakai displays the Guidance screen again.
                     </li>
                     						
                  </ul>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>To save the information you have entered or attached, click Save. Sakai saves the information in the wizard and displays the
                  Add Wizard, step 2, screen again. If you have entered text, that text is displayed in the appropriate part of the screen.
                  If you have attached a file, its name is displayed. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To explain the purpose of the wizard to site participants, click Add Rationale. Sakai displays the Add Rationale screen. Except
                  for its name, it is identical to the Guidance screen shown above. Proceed as instructed in steps 2 and 3. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add examples to show users how to use the wizard, click Add Examples. Sakai displays the Add Example screen. Except for
                  its name, it is identical to the Guidance screen shown above. Proceed as instructed in steps 2 and 3. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add a form with which to collect participant reflections upon their work in the wizard, select the appropriate form from
                  the Reflection pulldown list.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add a form in which reviewers will provide formative feedback to participants, select the appropriate form from the Feedback
                  pulldown list.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add a form in which reviewers will provide summative feedback to participants, select the appropriate form from the Evaluation
                  pulldown list. If you want participants to be able to modify their responses indefinitely, do not include an evaluation form
                  and do not identify evaluators for the wizard. In the absence of evaluation form and an evaluator to provide summative feedback,
                  the wizard has no end point, so participants can return to it and change it as desired.
               </li>
               					
               <li>To select people to provide summative feedback, click Select Evaluators. Sakai displays the Select Evaluators screen. The
                  window on the left side of the screen lists all roles defined for this site. Below the line, it also lists all site participants.
                  
               </li>
               					
               <li>To select evaluators, click the names of roles and/or individuals and then click the Add button. The roles you have selected
                  for evaluators must have permission to evaluate wizards. Furthermore, the individuals selected for evaluation must be assigned
                  a role selected for evaluation in the site. If these conditions are not met, the selected users will not be able to view and
                  evaluate wizards. For more information on setting permissions, "Changing Permissions for the Wizards Tool". To select more
                  than one role or person at a time, hold the CTRL key down as you click. Sakai displays the names of the roles and/or people
                  in the box on the right. 
               </li>
               					
               <li>To remove any of these roles or people from the list of selected evaluators, click their names and click the Remove button.</li>
               					
               <li>When you have identified all roles and/or individual participants who will act as evaluators, click Finish. Sakai displays
                  the Add Wizard, step 2, screen again. The screen shows the names of the roles and/or individuals you have selected as evaluators.
                  
               </li>
               					
               <li>Choose one of the following options:

                     <li>To create additional pages for this wizard, click Continue. Sakai displays the Add Wizard, step 3, screen. This screen varies,
                        depending on whether you are creating a sequential or hierarchical wizard. 
                     </li>
                     							
                     <li>To complete this wizard without adding additional pages to it, click Finish. Sakai displays the Wizards home page. Your new
                        wizard is listed on this screen.

                     <li>To return to the Add Wizard, step 1, screen, click Back. </li>
                     							
                     <li>To exit without creating this wizard, click Cancel. Sakai displays the Wizards home page. </li>
                     						
                  </ul>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>To add pages to this wizard, follow the instructions for either "Step 3: Adding Pages to a Sequential Wizard" or "Step 4:
                  Adding Categories, Subcategories, and Pages to a Hierarchical Wizard".
               </li>

                  of the Add Wizard, step 1, and the Add Wizard, step 2, screen. Just as those screens provided all the boxes, pulldown lists,
                  and access to files and forms that you needed for the wizard as a whole, this screen provides the boxes you need to define
                  a single page in the wizard. This screen contains one new box, which is a pulldown list for adding forms for site participants
                  to use in completing this page of the wizard. 
               </li>

               <li>To select forms for participants to complete, select a form from the Forms pulldown list and click Add. Sakai displays the
