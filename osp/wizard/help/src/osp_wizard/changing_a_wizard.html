            <h2>Changing a Wizard</h2>
            				
            <p>The Wizards tool allows you to change wizards in these ways:</p>
            				
            <ul>
               					
               <li>Change the name and other attributes of the wizard.</li>
               					
               <li>Change content of wizard pages and categories</li>
               					
               <li>Change the order of pages in a category (hierarchical wizards only)</li>
               					
               <li>Change the order of categories in the wizard</li>
               					
               <li>Move pages to another category</li>
               					
               <li>Delete individual pages and categories</li>
               				
            </ul>
            				
            <p>To make any of these changes, access the Wizards tool and follow these steps: </p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If the Wizards home page is not displayed, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the wizard you want to change and click the Revise link beneath its name. Sakai displays the Revise Wizard, Step 1 screen.
                  Except for its name, this screen looks like the Add Wizard, Step 1 screen.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Referring to the instructions given in "Step 1: Creating the Wizard," steps 5 - 7, change entries as appropriate.</li>
               					
               <li>If you press Continue, Sakai displays the Revise Wizard, Step 2, screen. Except for its name, this screen is identical to
                  the Add Wizard, Step 2 screen.
               </li>
               					
               <li>Referring to the instructions in "Step 2: Adding Wizard Support", change entries, as appropriate. If you press Continue, Sakai
                  displays the Revise Wizard, Step 3, screen. This screen varies, depending on whether you are revising a sequential or hierarchical
                  wizard. Note that categories and pages are identified by different icons: 
                  <ul>
                     							
                     <li>down-facing triangle denotes a category that contains pages.</li>
                     							
                     <li>right-facing triangle denotes a category that contains no pages.</li>
                     							
                     <li>circle denotes a page.</li>
                     						
                  </ul>
                  					
               </li>
               					
               <li>To make other types of changes, choose one or more of these options: 
                  <ul>
                     							
                     <li>To add pages to a sequential wizard, see "Step 3: Adding Pages to a Sequential Wizard".</li>
                     							
                     <li>To add categories and/or pages to a hierarchical wizard, see "Step 4: Adding Categories, Subcategories, and Pages to a Hierarchical
                        Wizard".
                     </li>

               </li>
               					
               <li>Exit from the screen in one of these ways: 
                  <ul>
                     							
                     <li>To save your work and return to the Wizards home page, click Finish.</li>
                     							
                     <li>To save your work and return to the Add Wizard, Step 2, screen, click Back. </li>
                     							
                     <li>To return to the home page without saving any of the changes you have made, click Cancel.</li>
                     						
                  </ul>
