            <h2>Publishing a Wizard</h2>
            				
            <p>Publishing a wizard makes it available to site participants. 
               <i>Caution</i> After a wizard has been published, you cannot add, move, reorder, or delete any of the categories or forms in it, nor can
               you delete the wizard itself. For this reason, we strongly recommend that you publish a wizard only when you are sure it contains
               the components you want in the order you want them.
            </p>
            				
            <p>To publish a wizard, access the Wizards tool and follow these steps:</p>
            				
            <ol>
               					
               <li>If Sakai is not displaying the Wizards home page, click the Reset button.</li>
               					
               <li>Find the wizard you want to change, and click Publish. Sakai publishes the wizard and redisplays the home page.</li>
               				
            </ol>
