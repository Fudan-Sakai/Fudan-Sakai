<h2>Polls: Overview</h2>
  <h3>What it does</h3>
  <p>The Poll tool allows users to set up an online vote. </p>

<h3>Key Concepts</h3>
  <p><strong>Vote</strong>: Users can vote for one or more of any number of answer 
    options. The structure of the vote is governed by a maximum and minimum number 
    of options that may be selected.<br>
    <strong>Results</strong>: You can choose when results are available to voters: 
    immediately, after voting, after the closing date, or never. </p>

<h3>Things to Consider</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Voting is anonymous.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Participants may only vote once per poll.
  </li>
  <li> 
    A poll can only consist of one question. If you want 
      to ask a set of related questions it might be better to use the Tests and 
      Quizzes tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can allow spoilt votes by selecting zero as the minimum number of answer options.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a Poll</h3>
<ol>
  <li> 
    To create a poll, click on <strong>Add</strong>.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Enter the Poll Question and any additional instructions 
      such as the number of answers that the voter may select.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Choose an opening date and a closing date, between which participants will be able to cast their votes.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Next, select the maximum and minimum number of answer 
      options that a user may select. If you want users to only select one option 
      from the possible answers given, set both numbers to 1. If users may select 
      more than one option, adjust these settings accordingly.
  </li>
  <li> 
    Decide how and when results will be visible:
<blockquote>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Always</strong> allows participants to see the results from the 
    open date, even if they havenâ€™t voted.</li>
  <li><strong>Never</strong> restricts participants from seeing the results</li>
  <li><strong> To participants who have voted</strong> allows participants to 
    see the results from the open date, but only after they have voted</li>
  <li><strong>After closing date</strong> restricts access to the results until 
    the closing date, after which all participants (regardless of whether they 
    have voted or not) will be able to view them.</li>
</ul>
