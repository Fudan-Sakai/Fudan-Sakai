<H2>Syllabus Tool Overview</H2>

<H3>What it does</H3>
<P>The syllabus is the official outline for your course. As an instructor, if
you or your department has prepared an online syllabus already, you can direct
the Syllabus Tool to link to it.</P>
<P>Otherwise, you can enter material to post directly to your syllabus. As you
create a syllabus, you can designate that it be viewable by the general public
or just to members of your course. </P>
<P>Some features of a traditional syllabus are divided between the Syllabus and
Schedule areas. Some instructors use the Syllabus area to display the
department's official online syllabus, and use the Schedule as a detailed
resource for students.</P>
<H3>Key concepts</H3>Content format: If you'd like to include HTML tags, you can
choose to format your syllabus content in HTML instead of plain text.
<H3>Things to consider</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>There are multiple options for making Web resources available. Before you
  link to a Web resource, consider whether it would be better placed as a
  schedule item (such as a topic for the week or a dated assignment), or as a
  resource in the Resources section. <BR clear=none><BR clear=none>
