This directory contains work in progress.

The goal of this effort is to develop a set of User, Realm, and Course
providers which read from a set of database tables based on a subset
of IMS Enterprise.  Table and column names and data conventions are
taken directly form IMS enterprise.

This work will not be completed for the Sakai 2.0 release and work 
wil continue on this under the auspices of the Sakai Enterprise
Discussion Group.  

If you are interested in working with this code and helping to
complete its development please join that discussion group.

To use this provider, it is necessary to uncommment the configuration information
in the files

    ../component/src/webapp/WEB-INF/components.xml
and
    ../component/project.xml
