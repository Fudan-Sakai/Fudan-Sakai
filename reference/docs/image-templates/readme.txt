DOCUMENTATION

A good start for developers interested in working with Sakai is the wiki
space named "Programmer's Cafe," where many tutorials and tips have
been collected by community developers.

	http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/BOOT/Home

Technical documentation and white papers can be found in the architecture/
directory.

The Sakaipedia is also a good place to search for nuggets of 
insight into particular questions.

COMMUNITY

Most Sakai collaboration happens in one (or both) of two arenas: the
collab server, and the Confluence wiki already linked to here a
number of times (bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence).

The collab server is a fully functional Sakai deployment, with sites
set up for community sub-groups, but in day-to-day activity it is
used most often as a kind of listserv.  You're encouraged to set up an 
account on the collab server and join any groups you like at:

	http://collab.sakaiproject.org
	
The most active site there is the "DG: Development" site, otherwise known as "sakai-dev".
