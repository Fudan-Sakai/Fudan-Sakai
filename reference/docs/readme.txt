DOCUMENTATION

A good start for developers interested in working with Sakai is the wiki
space named "Programmer's Cafe," where many tutorials and tips have
been collected by community developers.

Technical documentation and white papers can be found in the architecture/
directory.

COMMUNITY

Most Sakai collaboration happens in one (or both) of two arenas: the
collab server, and the Confluence wiki already linked to here a
number of times (bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence).

The collab server is a fully functional Sakai deployment, with sites
set up for community sub-groups, but in day-to-day activity it is
used most often as a kind of listserv.  You're encouraged to set up an 
account on the collab server and join any groups you like at:

	http://collab.sakaiproject.org
	
The most active site there is the "DG: Development" site, otherwise known as "sakai-dev".
