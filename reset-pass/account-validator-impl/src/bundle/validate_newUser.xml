		<subject> Welcome To ${localSakaiName}!</subject>
		<message>${addedBy} (${addedByEmail}) has invited you to join the ${memberSites} site on ${localSakaiName}.

Accept this invitation ${url}

What is ${localSakaiName}?
${localSakaiName} is the ${institution}’s web-based content management system. It is home to many course sites, as well as a host of other sites including those used for administration, research and project groups, libraries and student societies. As a guest user, you have been invited to join a ${localSakaiName} site. On the site you will have rights to read content but you also may be able to create and/or edit content (depending on your assigned role).

What if I already have a ${localSakaiName} account?
If you have used ${localSakaiName} in the past then you already have a ${localSakaiName} account, in
which case we strongly suggest that you accept the above invitation and then
indicate which existing ${localSakaiName} account you wish to use to access this site. This
will avoid you having multiple accounts, each with a different set of
associated sites. If you do not choose to associate this site with an existing
account, a new guest account will be created for you using this email
address. And in the future to access the site you must login to ${localSakaiName} using the
guest account username and its associated password.</message>
