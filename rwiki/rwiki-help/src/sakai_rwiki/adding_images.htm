<h2>Adding images and attachments</h2>
<h3>Adding images</h3>
<p>Before you add an image, make sure that it is the correct size and shape 
    for your web page, and that the file size is optimised for the web. If you 
    put an image with a very large file size into a wiki page, it will take a 
    long time for users to download it. Many painting programmes will allow you 
    to compress images for the web. </p>
<p>To add an image, select the 'edit' button to edit the page. Then select the 
    'embed resource' button. This will take you to your Resources folder. You 
    can either click 'select' to select an existing image on your worksite or 
    click 'add new' to upload a new image from your computer. When you have chosen 
    your image, click 'finish'.Your image will be inserted into your page. 
  </p>
<p>If you update the image in Resources, your image in Wiki will automatically 
    be updated too.</p>
<h3>Adding attachments</h3>
<p>Select the 'edit' button to edit the page. Then select the 'resource link' 
    button. This will take you to your Resources folder. You can either click 
    'select' to attach an existing resource on your worksite or click 'add new' 
    to attach a new resource from your computer. When you have chosen your image, 
    click 'finish'.Your image will be inserted into your page. </p>
<p>Attachments are stored in Resources but you don't need to have the 
    Resources tool enabled to add attachments. You can link to any sort 
    of resource that you create in Resources  so, any type of file you 
    upload, or an HTML file or text file you create. </p>
<p>If you update the file in Resources, your attachment will automatically be 
    updated too.</p>
