<h2>Editing your pages</h2>
<p>To edit the contents of a page, select the 'Edit' button at the top of the 
    page. Make your changes in the text box. Then select the 'Save' button at 
    the top of the page.&nbsp; Your changes will appear in the wiki page for everyone 
    to see.</p>
<p>If you receive a message <b><i>Permission Denied</i></b> when you try to edit a page, 
    you do not have permission to update pages. If you think this is a mistake, 
    you will need to talk to your site administrator to change this.</p>
<h3>Formatting your page</h3>
<p>When you edit the page, you will see a 'cheat sheet' displayed on the page 
    to the right. This gives you a brief introduction to the codes used for text 
    formatting in Wiki. The 'cheat sheet' links to a full help page. Use this 
    help page to get full information on text formatting, including superscripts, 
    different sorts of lists, etc.</p>
<h3>Linking to another wiki page</h3>
<p>To add a link to another Wiki page, type the name of that page within square 
    brackets. For example, typing '[page 2]' will link to a page called 'page 
    2'.</p>
<p>If you accidentally delete something that you didn't want to, this is not 
    a problem. See the page history for more details. </p>
<h3>Linking to external web pages</h3>
<p>To add a link to an external web page, type the full URL including 'http://'. 
    For example, 'http://www.bbc.co.uk'. </p>
<p>You can also click 'external link', which will insert an example link which 
    you can edit. </p>
<h3>What happens if someone else is changing the page at the same time?</h3>
<p>If someone else has edited and saved the page while you have been editing 
    it, you will see a message to say that the page has altered, and their new 
    page will be displayed above yours. You can then decide to overwrite their 
    changes (using the 'overwrite' button) or to keep their changes (using the 
    'save' button). </p>
