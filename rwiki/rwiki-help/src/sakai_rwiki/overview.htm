<h2>Wiki: Overview</h2>
<h3>What is a Wiki?</h3>
<p>A Wiki is a tool for people with no technical knowledge to change and create 
    web pages. Wiki was designed specifically for researchers and lecturers to 
    collaborate on documents, share information and create teaching materials. 
  </p>
<p>Wiki uses the Radeox engine and hence has the same markup as mainstream 
    wiki tool like SnipSnap. It has been implemented in such a way as to allow 
    Radeox based wiki macros to be used. (eg Radeox RSS Aggregator). Wiki 
    is designed and developed at the Centre for Applied Research into Educational 
    Technology (CARET) at Cambridge University. </p>
