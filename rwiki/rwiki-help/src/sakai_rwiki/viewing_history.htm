<h2>Viewing page history</h2>
<p>To get the history of any page, select the 'history' option from the menu. 
  </p>
<p>This gives you the following options</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>Gives a list of all previous versions of that page, with the name of the 
      user who altered it and the date.</li>
    <li>Allows you to view any previous version.</li>
    <li>Compare the contents of any version with the current version.</li>
    <li>Compare the contents of any version with the version immediately previous, 
      to see what changes were made by each user.</li>
    <li>Allows you to revert to any previous version.</li>
  </ol>
<p>If you have accidentally deleted content from your page, you can use the 
    'revert to this version' option to revert to an earlier, correct version, 
    for example. </p>
