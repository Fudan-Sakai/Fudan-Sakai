<h2>Viewing Pages</h2>
<p>To move from page to page in Wiki, follow the links within each page. Links 
    with a world icon beside them link to external websites or to attachments. 
    These will open in a new window.</p>
<p>As you navigate around Wiki, your breadcrumb trail will appear at the top 
    of the page. (A breadcrumb trail lists the pages that you have visited in 
    order.) You can use this to return to any page at any time.</p>
<p>Unlike some wiki tools, Wiki does not have a separate menu to navigate through 
    the pages. All navigation must be done through links on the pages. </p>
<h3>Searching for content</h3>
<p>To search for content, type your search term in the search box and press 
    'return'. All pages on that wiki site containing your search terms will be 
    listed. Don't forget that pages which are not in the wiki will not be searched. 
    This includes other Sakai pages (e.g. Schedule, Syllabus) and attachments 
    to the wiki.</p>
<p>This search will be recorded in your breadcrumb trail and you can return 
    to your results page at any time.</p>
<p>Wiki will recognise the 'and' operator but not 'not' or 'or'. For example, 
    searching for 'children and dahlias' will find pages which contain both the 
    word 'children' and the word 'dahlias' but not pages which contain one of 
    the words but not both.</p>
