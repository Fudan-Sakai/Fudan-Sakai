      JRCS is a library that knows how to manipulate the archive files
      produced by the RCS and CVS version control systems. JRCS is not
      intended to replace neither tool. JRCS was written to be able
      create archive analysis tools that can do things like identify
      hot spots in the source code, measure the contributions by each
      developer, o assess how bugs make it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reasons why JRCS has the ability do do check-ins and save
      archives is API symmetry, and to simplify the writing of unit
      tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff diff} package implements
      the differencing engine that JRCS uses. The engine has the power
      of Unix diff, is simple to understand, and can be used
      independently of the archive handling functionality. The entry
      point to the differencing engine is class {@link
      org.apache.commons.jrcs.diff.Diff Diff}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {@link org.apache.commons.jrcs.rcs rcs} package implements th8e
      archive handling functionality. The entry point to the library is
      class {@link org.apache.commons.jrcs.rcs.Archive Archive}.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>CAVEAT UTILITOR:</b> Do not make modifications to your
      archives with JRCS. There needs to be an important amount of
      additional testing before it's safe to do that.
