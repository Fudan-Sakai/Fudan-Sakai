<a name="intro"> </a><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any
assessment listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> You should not use the Immediate Feedback
setting in Tests &amp;
Quizzes when assessing learning, as it may provide
information students can use to correct their answers before
submitting a test.  </p>

<a name="partpend"> </a>

<h4>Of a pending assessment</h4>


<p>To modify the parts (i.e., sections) of any assessment listed
under "Pending Assessments":</p>

<ol><li>To enter the editing screen, from the drop-down menu to the left
of the assessment title, select <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. At the top, you will
see a bar containing the following options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To create a part, click <strong><code>Add Part</code></strong>. To edit a part, click
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong> to the right of the part that you wish to edit.
</li><li>To modify the settings for the assessment as described above,
click <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.
</li><li>To see how the assessment will appear to those taking it, click
<strong><code>Preview</code></strong>.
</li><li>To publish the assessment, click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong>. This will take
you to the <strong><code>Settings</code></strong> menu, where you can make adjustments and
publish the assessment.
</li></ul><br />
</li><li>Every assessment must contain at least one part. Parts are
signified within an assessment by a box containing the part title, a
drop-down list for determining the order of the parts, plus three
options: <strong><code>Copy to Pool</code></strong>, <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>, and
<strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. (If there is only one part, the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option
will not appear.) Each new assessment will include an automatically
created part called "Default". You have the following
options:

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To change the order in which a part appears in your assessment,
change the number in the drop-down list in the part's title bar.
</li><li>To remove a part, click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>. You'll have the option to
remove the part only (and move its questions to another part), or
remove the part and all its questions.
</li><li>To edit the part, click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You can then do the following:
<br /><br />
<ul><li>Change the title. If you do not change the default part's name,
its heading will not appear on your assessment. Any questions or
images you place in this part <strong>will</strong> appear; only the
heading will be hidden.
</li><li>Modify the "Information" field.
</li><li>Choose to create questions individually, or have them randomly
drawn from one of your question pools. For the random draw, you must
also specify how many questions to pull from which question pool,
the point value for the questions, and the type of randomization.
</li><li>Change the order of the questions within the part; choose either
<strong><code>As listed on Assessment Questions page</code></strong> or <strong><code>Random within
Part</code></strong>.
</li><li>Modify the "Objective", "Keyword", and "Rubric" metadata fields.
</li></ul>
<br /></li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save your changes.
</li></ul></li></ol>
