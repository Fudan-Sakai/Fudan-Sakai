<h2>Retracting or removing an assessment</h2>




<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can remove (i.e., delete) both pending assessments and published assessments.
You can also retract a published assessment from student access, and then
make it available to students again later.</p>

<h3>Retracting a published assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments", from the
drop-down menu for the assessment you want to retract, select <strong><code>Settings</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Settings page, click <strong><code>Delivery Dates</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can either retract your assessment immediately or specify a
date and time.

<br /><br />

<ul><li>To retract the assessment immediately, click <strong><code>Retract
Now</code></strong>. This will take you to the Immediate Assessment Retract
Confirmation page, where you can click <strong><code>Retract</code></strong> to continue or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to return to the Settings page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To retract the assessment at a specified date and time, click the
calendar icon to the right of the "Retract Date" text box.  Select a
date and time, and then, at the bottom of the screen, click <strong><code>Save
Settings</code></strong>.
</li></ul>
</li></ol>



<p>When you retract an assessment, it remains under "Published
Assessments", but moves from the "Active (testing in progress)"
section to the "Inactive (no student access)" section.</p>

<p>To return a retracted assessment to active status (i.e., to re-open it for submissions), follow the above
steps, but delete the date and time from the "Retract Date"
text box. The assessment will have the same URL as it did before you
retracted it.</p>

<h3>Removing an assessment</h3>

<ol><li>Under "Published Assessments" or "Pending Assessments", from the
drop-down menu for the assessment in question, select <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> again to confirm.
 </li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing a published assessment deletes all student
submissions and the corresponding gradebook item.</p>
