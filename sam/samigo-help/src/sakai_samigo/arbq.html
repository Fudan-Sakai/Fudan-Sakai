<h2>Modifications to
published assessments</h2>













<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any
assessment listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>

<p>To remove a published assessment, from the Assessments screen,
click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> below the published assessment you wish to
remove. When you are prompted to confirm the removal, click
<strong><code>Remove</code></strong> again.</p>
