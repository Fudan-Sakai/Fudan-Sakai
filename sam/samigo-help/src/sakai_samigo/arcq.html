<h2>Creating a survey</h2>




<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>Although the language in the tool makes it appear that all assessments
must be graded, you can create an ungraded assessment, such as a
survey or ungraded test, using the same process you would to create a
graded test or quiz.  Simply create an assessment with appropriate questions
and settings for your purpose.</p>

<p>The "Survey" question type allows you to choose from a predefined set
of scales commonly used for survey reporting. Those scales are as
follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong><code>Yes, No</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Agree</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Disagree, Undecided, Agree</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Below Average -&gt; Above Average</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Strongly Disagree -&gt; Strongly Agree</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>Unacceptable -&gt; Excellent</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 5</code></strong> </li><li><strong><code>1 -&gt; 10</code></strong> </li></ul>

<p>You can also use other question types in a survey, such as multiple
choice, true/false, and short answer/essay.  However, multiple choice
and true/false questions require you to specify a correct answer.  As
long as the Answer Point Value for the questions is set to zero or the
gradebook options for the assessment are set to <strong><code>None</code></strong>, this
will have no practical effect.  For multiple choice questions, you may
want to choose <strong><code>Multiple Correct, Single Selection</code></strong> or
<strong><code>Multiple Correct, Multiple Selection</code></strong> and check all listed
answers as correct to avoid misleading statistics when you are viewing 
the results.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When participants are ready to submit their
survey responses, they must click <strong><code>Submit for grading</code></strong>.  To
avoid any confusion, tell participants in advance that the survey
results will not be graded, and relate any other needed information
about how you will use the survey results.</p>
