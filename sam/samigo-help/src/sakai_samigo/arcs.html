<h2>Restricting access to published
assessments</h2>




<p>You cannot modify the access settings of a published assessment,
but you can remove a published assessment, modify the access settings
in the pending assessment, and publish it again. To remove a published
assessment, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arba">Retracting or removing an assessment</a>. To change the
access settings, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>

<p>You can modify the settings, parts, and questions of any
assessment listed under "Pending Assessments". When you publish an
assessment, a copy is created and listed under "Published
Assessments". For the published copy, you can make changes to all the
settings except "Assessment Released To".</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After you've published an assessment, if you
modify its "Pending Assessments" copy, you'll have to alter the
assessment's name before publishing it. When you publish it,
you'll be creating another copy under "Published Assessments", not
replacing the existing published copy.</p>
