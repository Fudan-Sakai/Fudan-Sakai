<h2>Publishing an assessment</h2>






<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>The act of making an assessment available to its users is referred
to as publishing. Users will not be able to access your assessment
until it is published. You should make all modifications and
corrections to an assessment before publishing it. If you find an
error or wish to otherwise modify a published assessment, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arab">Modifying an existing assessment</a>.</p>

<p>To publish an assessment you've created:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the relevant course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a>, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.  <br /><br />

</li><li>On the <code>Assessments</code> page, under "Pending Assessments", click
the <strong><code>--Select Action--</code></strong> drop-down box next to the assessment
that you wish to publish and choose <strong><code>Publish</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the <code>Settings</code> page, make sure all settings are
configured as you want them, and then click <strong><code>Save Settings and
Publish</code></strong>.

<p>For more information about the settings and their
options, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arag">Assessment settings</a>.</p>
</li><li>On the <code>Publish Assessment</code>
page, you'll see the settings you configured for the assessment, plus
a URL you can use to distribute the assessment.  You can
choose to send an email notification to students upon publishing the
assessment. Click <strong><code>Publish</code></strong> again to confirm, or
<strong><code>Cancel</code></strong> to abort.
</li></ol>

<p>On the <code>Assessments</code> page, your newly published
assessment will appear under "Published Assessments"; a copy also
remains under "Pending Assessments" in case future modifications are
necessary.</p>
