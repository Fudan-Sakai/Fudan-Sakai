<h2>Resume taking a saved assessment</h2>






<p>To resume working on an assessment that you had previously saved
(i.e., in which you clicked <strong><code>Save</code></strong>):</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the instructor has enabled the Automatic
Submission feature and your assessment's due date has passed, your
saved assessment may have been submitted automatically.</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the site, click <strong><code>Tests &amp;
Quizzes</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Take an assessment", click the title of the assessment you
wish to work on, and then click <strong><code>Begin Assessment</code></strong> to resume
your work where you left off.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you have finished, click <strong><code>Submit for Grading</code></strong>. You will
receive a confirmation number that you should keep. Alternatively,
click <strong><code>Save</code></strong> to save (but not submit) your work.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong><code>Save</code></strong> option is not
available in timed assessments or in assessments accessed via a
URL. Additionally, if you access the assessment via a URL and leave
the assessment without clicking <strong><code>Submit</code></strong>, your answers will be
lost. </p>
