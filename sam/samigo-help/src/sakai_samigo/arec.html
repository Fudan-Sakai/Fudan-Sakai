<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>On the Assessments page, click the <strong><code>--Select Action--</code></strong>
drop-down menu next to the title of the assessment you wish to work
on, and choose <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>. You'll see a list of questions for that
assessment. For each question, from the "Question" drop-down list,
select the numerical order in which you'd like that question to
appear. For example, if you'd like a question to be the third
question, select <strong><code>3</code></strong>.</p>

<p>When you reorder a question, it will move questions that were
originally above it down the list, and questions that were originally
below it up the list. For example, if you use the drop-down list to
change question 3 to question 1, then question 1 will become the new
question 2, and question 2 will become the new question 3. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot set the order of questions if the
part containing them is configured for random ordering.</p>
