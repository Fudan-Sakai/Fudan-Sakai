<h2>Moving questions between parts of an
assessment</h2>




<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>To move individual questions from one part to another within an
assessment:</p>

<ol><li>On the Assessments page, from the drop-down
list of the assessment you wish to work on, select <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.  You'll see
a list of questions for that assessment.<br /><br />
</li><li>For each question you'd like to move to a different part,
click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>From the <strong><code>Assign to Part</code></strong> drop-down list, select the part where
you'd like that question to appear. For example, if you'd like a
question to be in the first part, select <strong><code>1</code></strong>.<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Save</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>To move every question from one part to another part (i.e., remove
a part, but keep its questions):</p>

<ol><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> next to the
part you are deleting.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The first part listed on the editing screen
will not have the <strong><code>Remove</code></strong> option. To remove the first part,
you must switch its order with another part (if you don't have another
part, you'll have to create one), and then click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.</p>
</li><li>Select <strong><code>Remove part only and move question(s) to</code></strong>, and use
the accompanying drop-down list to choose a destination part.<br /><br />
</li><li>Click <strong><code>Remove</code></strong>.
</li></ol>
