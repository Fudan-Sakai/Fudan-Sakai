<h2>Sharing question pools</h2>




<p>By default, only you will be able to access the question pools you
create, but you can share your question pools with other instructors
from within the application.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can only share a question pool with a user
who has permission to create assessments, and you must share the
question pool from a site for which both you and the user have such a
role; it does not have to be the site where you created the pool.
Once someone shares a question pool with you, you can then access the
pool from any site in which you have the ability to create
assessments, unless the creator of the pool revokes access.</p>

<p>To share your question pool with someone:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>;
then, at the top of the page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of your desired question pool, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Grant access", check the box(es) for the instructors with
whom you would like to share the question pool, and then click
<strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p>To revoke access to a question pool you've shared:</p>

<ol><li>In the menubar, click <strong><code>Tests &amp; Quizzes</code></strong>;
then, at the top of the page, click <strong><code>Question Pools</code></strong>.  

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of your desired question pool, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Under "Revoke access", check the box(es) for the
instructors with whom you no longer want to share the question
pool. Then, click <strong><code>Share</code></strong>.
</li></ol>
