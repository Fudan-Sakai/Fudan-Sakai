<h2>Types of questions available for
assessments</h2>





<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>You have a great deal of flexibility in creating content for
assessments. You can use the question types listed below in any
combination within an assessment. For instructions on creating each
type of question, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqyr">Creating questions for an assessment</a>.</p>

<p>Following is an overview of the question types available:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Multiple Choice:</strong> Presents users with a question
followed by a list of possible answers. You can choose to have either
one or several correct answers.

<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Survey:</strong> Designed for collecting survey data;
presents users with a question or statement to which they respond
using the rating scale of your choice:<br /><br /> <ul><li><strong>Dichotomous:</strong> Choose from "Yes, No" or "Disagree,
Agree".
</li><li><strong>Likert scales:</strong> Choose from semantic or numeric
differentials (e.g., Strongly disagree-Strongly agree, 1-5)</li></ul><br />

</li><li><strong>Short Answer/Essay:</strong> Presents users with a
question followed by a text box in which they enter the
answer<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Fill in the Blank:</strong> Presents users
with a question followed by a text box in which they enter the answer;
each user's answer is compared to a list of allowed answers<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Numeric Response:</strong> Presents users with a question
followed by a text box in which they enter a numeric answer; each
user's answer is compared to a list of allowed answers <br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Matching:</strong> Presents users with a series of choices
and possible matches<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>True/False:</strong> Presents users with a
statement that they must identify as being either true or
false<br /><br />

</li><li><strong>Audio Recording:</strong>
Presents users with a question that they must answer audibly;
recording applet opens and allows user to record the answer using a
microphone <br /><br />

</li><li><strong>File Upload:</strong> Presents a question or assignment
that requires the user to upload a file<br /><br />
</li><li><strong>Copy from Question Pool:</strong> Allows you to import
questions from an existing question pool that you created. For more
information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arej">Adding, moving, copying, or removing a question pool or subpool</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>You can set an answer point value for each question. Survey
questions are automatically worth 0 (zero) points, but if you want, you can assign points to a survey question. Also, each of the above is
scored automatically, except for the short answer/essay, audio recording, and file
upload questions.
