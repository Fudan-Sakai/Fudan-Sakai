<p>In the Tests &amp;
Quizzes tool, you can create your questions offline in the
format described here, and then copy and paste them into a new
assessment by clicking <strong><code>Create using markup text</code></strong>.  If you
choose the default <strong><code>Create using assessment builder</code></strong> option
instead, you will create your questions in the question editor, and do
not need to use this document.  You can only use the markup text
option with the types of questions listed below; additional question
types are available in the question editor.  See <a href="content.hlp?docId=argy">Types of questions available for assessments</a> and <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardm">Creating a new assessment</a>.</p>

<a name="general"> </a><h4>General instructions</h4>

<p>For the tool to distinguish between questions, each question must
begin with the word "Question" or a number; for graded questions,
include the number of possible points in parentheses. All of the
following are legitimate:</p>

<span class="example">  Question 23 (10 points)
  Question (10 points)
  Question 23
  23. (10 points)
  23.</span>

<p>Note that the entries above without "(10 points)" would result
in a question worth zero points.</p>

<p>The text of the question itself may be placed on this same line or
below it, and should be followed by answers in the appropriate format
for that question type. The parser will use this format to deduce the
question type of the question.</p>
