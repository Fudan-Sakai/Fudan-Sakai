<h2>Adding an assistant to your site</h2> 


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently the specific role of teaching
assistant is available only in a course site. The owner of a project
site, however, can create an ad hoc teaching assistant by assigning
an equivalent role to a member of the site.</p>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you can add a teaching assistant to
your section, you will need to assign a teaching assistant role to
that person.</p>

<h4>Assigning the teaching assistant role to a member</h4>

<ol><li>In the relevant course site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.  <br /><br /></li><li>From the list of site participants, find the member you would like
to assign the role of teaching assistant.  <br /><br /> </li><li>Under "Role",
use the drop-down menu to select <strong><code>Teaching Assistant</code></strong>.  <br /><br /></li><li>When you are finished, click <strong><code>Update Participants</code></strong>.</li></ol>





<h4>Adding a teaching assistant to a section</h4>

<p>Once you have assigned a site member the role of teaching
assistant, you may assign the teaching assistant to a section.</p>

<ol><li>In the relevant course site, click <strong><code>Section Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br /> </li><li>Under the section in which you wish to add a teaching
assistant, click <strong><code>Assign TAs</code></strong>.

<br /><br /> </li><li>From the list of worksite members, select the participant you wish
to add, and click the right arrow to move the name to the box on the
right.

<br /><br /></li><li> When you are finished, click <strong><code>Assign TAs</code></strong>. To
cancel, click <strong><code>Cancel</code></strong>.
