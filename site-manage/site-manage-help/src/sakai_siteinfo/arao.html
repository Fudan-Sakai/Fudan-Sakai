<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete these procedures, you must be
assigned a role having the necessary permissions.  To determine your
role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a basic understanding of roles and
permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p>For any course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a> you create, you can import
instructor-generated content (e.g., announcements, assignments, tool
settings) from one or more other sites you own. Submitted material,
such as completed assignments, forum postings, or grades, cannot be
imported using the following methods; you must download and save such
material manually.</p>

<h3>Importing material from another site</h3>

<p>To import material from another site:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Site
Info screen, click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Import Data screen,
choose one of the following: <br /><br />

<ul><li><strong>I would like to replace my data</strong>: Use this option if you
want the imported data to overwrite the existing data.  This method
only allows you to select one site to import data from.
</li><li><strong>I would like to merge my data</strong>: Use this option if you
want the imported data to merge with the existing data.  This method
allows you to select multiple sites to import data from.
</li><li><strong>I would like to merge my user(s)</strong>: Use this option
if you want to import the participant roster from another site. This
method does not import roster-provided users.
 </li></ul><br />
</li><li>Select the box next to the site that contains the source
material. Then click
<strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If applicable, under the name of the site(s) you selected, check
the box next to each tool that contains source material you want to
import. If a box is grayed out, it means the corresponding tool is not
enabled in that site. Then click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<ul><li>Items saved as drafts in the source site will
be imported as drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When assignments are imported from another site, the <strong><code>Add to
Gradebook</code></strong> option is selected by default.  If such an assignment
is then updated and saved, a corresponding Gradebook entry will be
created, which may or may not be what was intended.  To associate the
item to an existing Gradebook entry rather than creating a new
Gradebook item from within the Assignments tool, select <strong><code>Associate
with existing Gradebook entry</code></strong> and choose the desired Gradebook
entry before posting.  For more on the differences between the two
options, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=avnd">Linking an assignment to the Gradebook</a>

<br /><br />
</li><li>When you import Gradebook settings, it may be possible to import
an item with a Gradebook Item Point Value of less than or equal to 0
(zero); however, if you try to edit such an item, you will receive an
error message.

</li></ul>
