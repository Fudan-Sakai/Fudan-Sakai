<h2>Tools for managing site email</h2>














<p>Two distinct tools, Email Archive and Messages, are available for
managing communication between site participants.  Additionally,
other site tools allow you to send email notifications to participants
when you add new items.</p>

<h4>Email Archive</h4>

<p>The Email Archive gives your site its own email address to use for
communications to all participants. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardh">Email Archive: Overview</a>.</p>

<h4>Messages</h4>

<p>The Messages tool allows participants to send individual messages
to others within your site. Messages also supports messaging among
multiple individuals and pre-defined groups. For more information, see
<a href="content.hlp?docId=avao">Messages: Overview</a>.</p>

<h4>Email notification</h4>

<p>Some tools (e.g., Announcements, Resources, and Syllabus) allow you
to send email notifications to site participants (at their email
addresses) when you add new items. You can specify a low-priority
email notification, which will be subject to each participant's
notification preferences, or high priority, which will override
individually set preferences so that all site participants receive the
notification.</p>
