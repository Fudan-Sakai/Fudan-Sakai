<h2>Sites tool: Overview</h2> 

<h3>What it does</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To use this tool, you must have
administrator rights. </p>

<p>With the Sites tool, system administrators can create new
worksites and modify and remove existing ones. Users with "admin"
rights will see the Sites tool in the My Workspace <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>.</p>

<p>When creating or editing a site, the administrator can select which
tools will appear in the main screen of the site's Home page. The
administrator can also rename the Home page and create additional
Home pages for the site.</p>


<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Assigning roles:</strong> The Sites tool allows the
administrator to specify which role to assign by default to people who
join the site. The site owner can later change a participant's role
with the Site Info tool.</p>

<p><strong>Adding tools:</strong> When an administrator adds tools to
a particular Home page, those tools appear in the main screen, not the
menubar. 

</p><h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>When the application is first installed, the admin is the only
pre-installed account. The admin can then create worksites.
<br /><br />
</li><li>The My Workspace template site is the site with the siteID
<code>!user</code>. Admins can edit this site to include or exclude
whatever tools they wish to display in their users' My Workspaces. All
users are assigned the broadest role in their respective My
Workspaces, which gives them edit control over that section.</li></ul>
