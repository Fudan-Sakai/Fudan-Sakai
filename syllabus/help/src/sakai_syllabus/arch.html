<h2>Syllabus: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The syllabus is the official outline for your course. As an
instructor, if you or your department has prepared an online syllabus
already, you can direct the Syllabus tool to link to it. Otherwise,
you can enter material to post directly to your syllabus. You can make
your syllabus visible to the general public or just to members of your
course.</p>

<p>Some features of a traditional syllabus are divided between the
Syllabus and Schedule tools. Some instructors use the
Syllabus tool to display the department's official online syllabus,
and use the Schedule as a detailed resource for students.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Content format:</strong> You can use the buttons at the top of
the editing window to format your content. The buttons supply any
needed HTML tags. You can toggle between viewing these HTML tags in
your content or not, and you may enter your own HTML tags instead of
relying on the buttons.  See <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbr">The WYSIWYG editor</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Attachments:</strong> You can attach files from your
Resources folders. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbh">Adding, editing, or deleting a syllabus item</a>.</p>
 
<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>You have several options for making web resources
available. Before you link to a web resource, consider whether it
would be better placed as a schedule item (such as a topic for the week or
a dated assignment), or as a resource in the Resources
section.<br /><br />
</li><li>If you attach a file from one of your other sites (including your
<a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>), your site participants won't be able to view it unless
you chose <strong><code>Display to non-members (publicly viewable)</code></strong> in that
file's properties. For more information, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=atkh">Making your Resources items publicly accessible</a>.
</li></ul>
