<h2>Become User: Overview</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Become User tool is an administrative tool to allow a user to log in as another user without needing a password. Logging in as another user is useful for support situations, since you&rsquo;ll be able to see the system from the point of view of that user.</p>
<p>To revert yourself back to the user account you started out in, you must logout and log back in using your account credentials.</p>
