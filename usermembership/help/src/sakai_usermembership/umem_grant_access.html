<h2>User Membership: Granting tool access to other users</h2>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These instructions requires Administrator privileges.</p>


<h3>Grant tool access</h3>
<p>Once the tool is added to a site, access must be granted to 
every user other than Administrator that will be using the User Membership tool. 
To grant tool access, log in as Administrator and follow these instructions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Enter the 'Realms' tool and search for the site having the User Membership tool. You may need to use the 'Sites' tool to find the corresponding site id.</li>
	<li>Click the site realm to edit (should look similar to /site/xxxxx).</li>
	<li>Scroll down and click on the appropriate role to edit it (typically, this should be the 'maintain' role). This should match the user role on the site.</li>
	<li>Check the 'usermembership.view' function and click 'Save' to persist changes.</li>
	<li>You should now be able to use the tool.</li>
</ol>
