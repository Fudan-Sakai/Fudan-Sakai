<h2>Viewing or adding a news feed</h2>
<p>If your site has a link to a news feed, it will appear in the site's
<a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>. Depending on how the site owner has set up the feed,
you may see <strong><code>News</code></strong> in the menubar, or a more descriptive title,
e.g., <strong><code>New York Times</code></strong>, <strong><code>CNN</code></strong>, or <strong><code>Yahoo!  News</code></strong>.</p>

<p>The News tool in a course or project site is an RSS "news
aggregator" (or newsreader) that reads and displays continuously
updated online content from RSS news feeds. If you have the necessary
permissions, you can customize your course or project site's News
feature by adding a web address for any RSS news feed.</p>

<p>In addition to news, some web sites use the RSS format for information
that is updated often, such as blogs, events listings, or
the revision history of a book. You can usually identify an RSS feed
URL by the <code>.xml</code> or <code>.rss</code> in the URL (e.g.,
http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/Movies.xml
or http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss). You
can also search the web for RSS feeds pertaining to a certain interest
or publication.</p>
