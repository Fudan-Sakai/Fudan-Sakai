<h2>News: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>
 
<p>The News tool uses RSS to bring dynamic news to your
worksite. RSS is a data format used to syndicate news on the web. It
allows continuously updated content from a remote news site to appear
in another web site.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>RSS:</strong> To set up your worksite to display news, you
must specify a URL pointing to an RSS news feed. An RSS
news feed is a specially formatted list of news articles. You can find
RSS feeds by using an Internet search engine (e.g., Google
or Yahoo). Sites that distribute news in RSS format are called "news
feeds". The News tool is an RSS "news aggregator" (or "news reader")
that reads and displays content from RSS news feeds.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>You can add more than one News feed either when you set up the
site or at a later time.

<br /><br />
</li><li>In addition to news, some web sites use the RSS format for
information that is updated often, such as blogs (web logs that serve
as publicly accessible personal journals), events listings, or the
revision history of a book.
</li></ul>
